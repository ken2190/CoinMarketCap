This is accomplished with a decentralized donation platform that aims to shift online entertainment compensation towards a direct creator-to-audience participation model.\r\n\r\nVDR is the native utility token that is used for:\r\n\r\n* Zero Fee Donations to Content Creators \r\n* Project voting, funding and crowdfunding\r\n* Redemption by content creators based on audience size\r\n\r\nBetween costly platform fees and algorithmic discrimination, it's hard for content creators to receive fair compensation without leaning fully on advertisements and promotions. The Vodra Platform allows creators to receive donations, crowdfunding, monthly pledges, and more - all with no fees. This is accomplished through our token and platform design that allows creators to be directly compensated by their audiences.\r\n\r\nThe Vodra Platform consists of a variety of tools and integrations that allow content creators to monetize their content across all platforms. From live donation alerts for broadcasts to exclusive NFT rewards, creators are able to engage with their audiences however they see fit.\r\n\r\nVodra Token (VDR) is an ERC-20 utility token that is redeemed by content creators based on their audience size. It is the native currency of the Vodra Platform, in which audiences use the token to donate to creators and unlock various utilities. A Polygon Proof-of-Stake bridge provides seamless transfers to the Matic/Polygon blockchain, which means functionality and transactions on the Vodra Platform completely avoid gas fees. \r\n\r\nContent creators across all platforms can join Vodra and redeem their audience sizes for VDR. Streamers, vloggers, athletes, musicians, gamers, educators and every other type of creative mind is able to monetize their content with Vodra's powerful tools and integrations. Creators can now hold a stake in where they receive their compensation from and no longer have to worry about income instability.\r\n\r\nHow Many VDR Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe VDR Token contract was deployed on March 2, 2021 with 2 Billion VDR tokens created on day one.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "71", "dateLaunched": "2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://vodra.io/home"], "technical_doc": ["https://vodra.io/VodraWhitepaper.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/address/0xed3d4e446a96dc3b181b64b75c3c70da41dc3cbe"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/Vodra-Token/VodraToken"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/vodratoken", "https://discord.com/invite/28c3sRbMw5"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/VodraToken"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/vodratoken?lang=en"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0xed3d4e446a96dc3b181b64b75c3c70da41dc3cbe", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0xed3d4e446a96dc3b181b64b75c3c70da41dc3cbe", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.91186752921941, "priceChangePercentage24h": 34.79177057, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.71962698}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.36960577973018, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.29293143, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.80735424}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0459154546492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.8379693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.59631629}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36217183431754, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.38713656, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.0655546}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08825297302251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.52298553, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.10265883}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34948277408693, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.0744453, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.19608689}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.84617771491492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.4837804, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.38743017}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884223796591, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.22962228, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.74739738}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05344197854214, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32002778, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.49536142}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:50:40.201Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
