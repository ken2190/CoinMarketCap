{"data": {"id": 9937, "name": "Parami Protocol", "symbol": "AD3", "slug": "parami-protocol", "category": "token", "description": "1 Overview\r\nParami Protocol proposed an AD 3.0 paradigm powered by blockchain for Web 3.0. It provides a protocol stack for building a user-centric, tokenized advertising economy. As a parachain built on Substrate, it serves all the other parachains in Polkadot/Kusama through relaychain.\r\n\r\n1.1 What is AD 3.0\r\nAD 3.0 is a human-centric and privacy-preserving network powered by blockchain, where users are smart-rewarded for attention and data while their self-sovereign identity is protected on a trust-free basis.\r\n\r\n1.2 Why AD3.0\r\nAD 1.0: Era of Slavery The AD model is inefficient and not transparent. Advertisers are faced with ambiguousness and fraud while users\u2019 data are being monetized without consent. Users become DATA SLAVES when they have no right over their data and cannot benefit from their engagement.\r\n\r\nAD 2.0: Era of Feudalism Incentive AD return parts of profits back to users but users are still not in charge of their own identity and data. Data are dispersed and isolated in various apps and websites where they can not be aggregated and utilized.\r\n\r\nAD 3.0: The AD network is democratic and governed by all token holders. The future network traffic is directly generated from the influence of each creator and token holders, instead of being acquired from a certain website or application. Users have absolute sovereignty over their own identity and data. They will receive smart-reward based on their attention paid and relevance score.\r\n\r\n2 Three-layered Protocol Stack\r\n\r\n2.1 DID Layer \r\n\u2022 DID Layer: Decentralized Identity management including registry, update and revoke. DID aggregates both social media identities and blockchain identity. \r\n\r\nParami Protocol provides a complete set of PDID (Parami DID) solutions compatible with W3C DID standard on Parami Node, and expands its business on the basis of DID standard. Parami Protocol will also provide DID aggregators for other DID standards.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Web2.0 Compatible: Parami DID provides a verification method that can connect to users\u2019Web 2.0 social media identities. \u2022 NO KYC: PDID allows users to verify DID uniqueness by building social graphs and running anti-sybil analysis without any KYC process.\r\n\r\n2.2 Privacy Layer\r\n\u2022 AD Privacy Layer: Privacy on advertising, including private file bonding, updating and monetization. \r\n\r\nThe AD Privacy Layer provides a personal crypto advertising preference (PCAP) document attached to user DID, which contains user advertising privacy management service. The PCAP document works not only for payment but also for user preference data. The preserved data can be used but can not be seen.\r\n\r\n2.3 Application Layer\r\n\u2022 Application Layer: Tokenized activities such as SmartDrop, Yield Farming, Social Coin Generation and NFT\r\n\r\nThe application layer provides decentralized oracle to collect data from conventional Internet for Ad verification. It also defines the interfaces for tokenized advertising dapp to get AD privacy support.\r\n\r\n\u2022PCAP data fetch: Dapp can fetch PCAP data (ZKP) of some DID to determine and verify the user reward he/she deserves. \u2022PCAP data update: Dapp can update (scoring some tags) PCAP data each time it sends reward to users, with updated data encrypted homomorphically.\r\n\r\n3 More Highlights\r\nIM support: Parami is designed for IM apps. The Parami SDK will support users to participate in Ad interaction in IM explorer or MiniApps. \r\nDAO support: Parami will support other DAOs as seed groups to expand DID ecosystem. Other DAOs can register on Parami and manage their DAOs on it for extra incentive. \r\nGovernance support: Parami Protocol is fully governed by all token holders. They can vote for the council and all the proposals to optimize the network. \r\nNFT: support Parami Protocol supports NFT as ticket, badge or collector for advertising campaign. \r\nYield Farming support: Parami supports liquidity mining (Yield Farming) so that users are able to exchange rewarded token to stable coins and advertisers can easily build an advertising fund", "dateAdded": "2021-05-19T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "icoStatus": "untracked_ico", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "135", "dateLaunched": "2020-05-21T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [{"slug": "defi", "name": "DeFi", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "substrate", "name": "Substrate", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "polkadot-ecosystem", "name": "Polkadot Ecosystem", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "genpad", "name": "Genpad", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "petrock-capital", "name": "PetRock Capital", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://parami.io"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://github.com/parami-protocol"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/paramiprotocolEN"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/paramiprotocol"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.20183531244782, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.13616826, "priceChangePercentage7d": 53.95596503}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.11344337944072, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.18449042, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.48248837}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04627457717797, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.91135231, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.45883406}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34617322631426, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.30909192, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.55452378}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08821362409385, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.42255504, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.13615696}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.32662201481798, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.95126771, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.27161668}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.69640107233936, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.40482406, "priceChangePercentage7d": 16.5160507}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12783130067915, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.95747271, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.47362042}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04646931829133, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.2717338, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.71622843}], "relatedExchanges": [], "ico": {"cryptoId": 9937, "cryptoSymbol": "AD3", "status": "Ended", "cryptoStatus": 16, "name": "Parami Protocol", "statistic": {"tokensForSale": 0.0, "raisedInUsd": 0.0}, "distribution": [{"holder": "Advisors", "percentage": 22.0}, {"holder": "Community", "percentage": 10.0}, {"holder": "Foundation", "percentage": 32.0}, {"holder": "Private Sale", "percentage": 5.0}, {"holder": "Public Sale", "percentage": 1.0}, {"holder": "Team", "percentage": 20.0}, {"holder": "Seed Sale", "percentage": 10.0}], "stages": [{"start": "2021-05-20T00:00:00.000Z", "end": "2021-05-21T02:00:00.000Z", "status": "Ended", "type": "IDO", "tokenForSale": 0.0, "icoPriceUsd": "0.0", "softCapUsd": 0.0, "personalCap": "TBA", "distributedInIcoPercentage": 0, "access": "Public", "comments": "N/A", "fundraisingGoalUsd": "0.0", "whereToBuyName": "Pre-IDO with Genesis Shards, INO with DEGO", "acceptedCurrency": "TBA"}]}, "isAudited": false, "distributions": [{"holder": "Advisors", "percentage": 22.0}, {"holder": "Community", "percentage": 10.0}, {"holder": "Foundation", "percentage": 32.0}, {"holder": "Private Sale", "percentage": 5.0}, {"holder": "Public Sale", "percentage": 1.0}, {"holder": "Team", "percentage": 20.0}, {"holder": "Seed Sale", "percentage": 10.0}]}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:38:23.602Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "29", "credit_count": 0}}
