{"data": {"id": 7789, "name": "OASISBloc", "symbol": "OSB", "slug": "oasisbloc", "category": "coin", "description": "OASISBloc, a data trading platform among diverse businesses and industries, was launched by OASISBloc Foundation based in Singapore in October 2018. The platform main-net was completed in August 2019 after successfully developing MVP and test-net. In October 2020, OASISBloc released its latest version of whitepaper (v.0.7.1) and business roadmap on the website. \n\nOne of the key features of OASISBloc is its inter-chain, which connects the domain chain of each industry. Interconnection of user accounts, data transaction history, and domain chain history interconnected to OASISBloc are all recorded and managed through OASISBloc, which turns data generated by each user into a standardized and valuable data. With these features, OASISBloc participants will be able to trade practical data to achieve mutual benefits.\n\nAnother key feature of OASISBloc is its self-developed ePoA (equitable Proof of Authority), and this consensus algorithm was designed to supplement the weak points of PoA where certain parties might be able to have too much authority. Regarding block generation, OASISBloc has a witness group that consists of 39 candidates for block generators, and this witness group is broken down into three levels, each of which selects the final block generator at random. Block generators generate and validate blocks for a swift and accurate recording on block every time there is a transaction of data trading, which exchanges value between domain chains. OASISBloc\u2019s consensus algorithm, ePoA, keeps the block generation process and history transparent, allowing anyone to experience the irreversibility of transaction and block validation.
