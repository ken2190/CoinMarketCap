{"data": {"id": 9503, "name": "CryptoTycoon", "symbol": "CTT", "slug": "cryptotycoon", "category": "token", "description": "# **What is CryptoTycoon?**\n\n[CryptoTycoon](http://cryptotycoon.finance/) is a gaming platform based on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Players can spend BNB, BUSD and other BSC-based tokens in the game to participate in game yield farming. The game system has a great token deflation mechanism and dividend bonus model.\n\nThe total amount of CTT tokens is 1 million, and 5% of the on-chain transaction amount will be burnt.\n\n# **Who are the founders of CryptoTycoon?**\n\nAll the founding members of CryptoTycoon have worked in Tencent Interactive Entertainment (IEG), and have been involved in product planning and front-end operations in first-line online games. After entering the crypto industry, the team still keeps paying attention to the gaming industry, and constantly seeks to lower the barriers to user participation of gamified DeFi products.  \n\nFor team background and CMO introduction, please read our[ Team Information](https://docs.cryptotycoon.co/whitepapers/team-background).\n\n# **What is Monopoly Tycoon?**\n\nMonopoly Tycoon is a monopoly game built on CryptoTycoon. To participate in-game mining, players can spend BNB, BUSD, USDT and other BSC tokens in the game to get a chance to roll the dice and build different types of buildings on different grids. In order to ensure the game has a good deflation and dividend model, once a house or shop is constructed and cannot pay taxes on time, it will be removed. \n\n# **What is FishSwap?**\n\nFishSwap is a fishing game built on CryptoTycoon. Players can spend BNB and BUSD to draw NFT Mystery Box for fishing rods in the game, so as to catch fish with different attributes in the fish pond. Whenever players catch the fish, players can then put the fish in their own fish ponds to get CTT mining output. At the same time, the game has a good token deflation mechanism and dividend model. Each fishing rod has its own durability, and each fish also has its own life cycle. If the player does not repair the fishing rod, it will be destroyed when the durability is 0.\n\n# **What is NFTSwap?**\n\nNFTSwap is the game prop store of the CryptoTycoon platform, which contains NFT information and purchase links for various games. Since the CryptoTycoon platform has acquired various NFTSwap first-level domain names from the market before the establishment of the CryptoTycoon platform, the game prop store is named NFTSwap. At present, the main function of the store is to display NFT character cards, game props, etc. It does not have transaction functions. Each NFT will mark the link to the transaction portal.\n\n# **Why $CTT?**\n\nCTT is the game token of CryptoTycoon, which has both functional and governance usages. It is currently running on Binance Smart Chain. The CryptoTycoon team has adopted a scientific mechanism and a method that has been verified many times by the market to design the CTT economic model.  \n\nAs CryptoTycoon continues to support more different chain CTT consumption, CTT will also circulate on more chains.  \n\nFor the usage, deflation, and distribution of CTT tokens, please refer to our[ Token Information](https://docs.cryptotycoon.co/whitepapers/ctt-tokens-and-institutional-fundraising).\n\n# **What\u2019s our Positioning?**\n\nCryptoTycoon is positioned to gamify the DeFi product, thereby reducing the threshold for players to get started. At the same time, CryptoTycoon's first release is built on the retail investor-friendly BSC blockchain, which has a good ecology and user base. Which can help the game advance in the right direction, keep iterating and updating, and provide a good motivation.\n\n# **Join us:**\n\n**Website: **[
