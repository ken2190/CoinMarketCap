{"data": {"id": 10153, "name": "SafeMeme", "symbol": "SME", "slug": "safememe", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is SafeMeme (SME)?\n\nSafeMeme ($SME) is a deflationary token that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), meaning there are virtually no gas fees and almost instantaneous swaps! This is a token that rewards holders and punishes sellers, which can encourage a steadier price action.\nSafeMeme is the first Rugpull-Proof utility token and all-in-one BSC platform. All projects will have to meet our security protocol and in-depth guidelines to assure new investors that their investments are safe! Having these new tokens follow our safety protocol significantly lowers the risk of investing in new projects.\nThe SafeMeme token is designed to reward its holders. Each transaction generates a 6% fee that translates to passive income!\n2% is redistributed between all holders.\n2% is burned, causing an increase in value.\n2% is sent to the liquidity pool, increasing the stability of SME.\n\n\n## Transparency\n\nWe have a dynamic, non-anon team on all our socials. The creator has been subject to a rug pull himself, so we know how horrible it is! We genuinely want to try and make this project succeed along with the community. That's why we promise to be active on all current socials, to answer any questions you may have, and to enforce a strong community spirit! A team wallet will be used for any costs associated with the project, for example, marketing, dev costs, exchange listing costs, etc. Everyone can see the transactions of this wallet as it is in the public domain. Furthermore, we will let everyone know of any significant transactions that will be withdrawn from this wallet.\n\n\n## The Vision\n\nSafeMeme's vision is to provide a solution to the significant issue that the market is facing. There are way too many \"rug pull\" scams where new BEP20 tokens are being created to scam new investors or FOMO investors into scam projects. We're building a platform where new projects will have to be audited before they will be listed; by doing that, new investors can come onto our platform to see which new projects have passed our safety protocol. That includes contract auditing, presale & launch auditing (avoiding whales, bots, whitelisting, etc.), tokenomics auditing, creating a protocol that solely approves non-risky projects. We're at the stage right now where we have a strong community backing us up; we already have the rules of what new projects have to meet to pass our audit. Now we started working on developing a BEP20 token exchange platform that is based on V2 liquidity. After that, we will begin taking applications from new BEP20 tokens; the auditing process will cost these projects a certain amount of money distributed between all wallet holders & the dev team for salaries, expenses, etc. Our end game: is to create a safe platform for new investors to have an additional layer of safety while investing in BEP20 tokens. While being a utility token, we are also a community-driven token that holders receive a portion of the auditing fee and selling fee (6% total fee, 2% burn, 2% redistribution between holders, 2% is added to the locked liquidity wallet. ). To summarize: we believe that the market is firmly in need of a project like SafeMeme, and we are here to stop the BEP20 token scams and restore faith in crypto investing.\n\n\n## Where Can I Buy SafeMeme (SME)?\n\nSafeMeme is currently available on PancakeSwap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x36dBcBCA106353D49e1E0E8974492fFB862a0C92.\n\n\n## Tokenomics\n\nWe have built a token that will reward you for holding it without having to stake it manually. Just sit back, relax, and watch your $SafeMeme automatically increase!\nEach transaction triggers a 6% fee, where 2% is redistributed to all the current holders in proportion to their existing holdings, 2% is burned, decreasing the token's total supply (making it more scarce over time), and 2% is added to the locked liquidity wallet.\nThis inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. Once SafeMeme is burned down to 100 Million tokens, the burning will stop to ensure the platform's longevity.\n5% Dev & Crew: 50,000,000,000 - Crew & Dev Token\n15% Treasury: 150,000,000,000 - Treasury Reserve - Platform Development, Marketing, Audits, Future Listings, Social Media Promos, Legal Fees, Business Fees.\n20% Liquidity Lock: 200,000,000,000 - Initial Liquidity - Locked For One Year\n35% Presale: 350,000,000,000\n25% Burn: 250,000,000,000 - 30 billion $SME burn on launch, and 20 billion $SME burn each month for 11 months.\nThe monthly burn will help stabilize the coin for the first year and reward those who hold long-term. This will provide enough time and stabilization to get the exchange up and running and widespread enough that the token can stabilize itself and increase in price per the exchange.\n\n##
