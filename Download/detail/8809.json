DINO redistributes 1% of every transaction to its holders and burns another 1% at the same time. \r\n\r\nThe DINO token at this time has two different uses:\r\nDINO is currently used to farm yDINO, a governance token which will be part of a complete ecosystem, by staking DINO and BNB on Tenet.\r\nDINO provides passive income to its users and holders through the 1% redistribution applied from every transaction\r\nNote:\r\nIt will be used in the near future as the central currency used in this ecosystem currently in development, where artists and collectors can buy and sell digital art goods using DINO Token.\r\n\r\nDINO Token itself has a growing community and is active in providing the community with updates and news.The project team is also reactive to the wants and requests of the community and responds to the community by delivering results based on these requests.\r\n\r\n## How Many DINO Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nAt DINO Token launched on March 2, 2021 with 10,000,000 DINO tokens hatched at the beginning of the project. Since there is a 1% burn involved on every transaction, at the time of writing there have been 1047979.41126 tokens burned, leaving 8,952,020.588739 tokens which are currently in circulation, either being staked for liquidity, staked for farming or in Pancakeswap.\r\n\r\n### Who Is the Founder of DINO Token?\r\n\r\nDINO Token was an idea originally hatched by Doc Perrys, a web developer with over 20 years of experience in the field. Working on various projects for a variety of clients over the years, he has also worked for institutions and newspapers. The developer had also been involved in the developing cryptocurrency projects starting back to 2014 and is experienced at crafting NFTs as well. Realizing that things needed to be changed with the current state of BSC projects, Doc Perrys brought his previous experiences into the project and developed DINO Token. He wishes to make the token play a crucial role at the centre of a new ecosystem. The developer chose not to hold a dedicated developer wallet and made the token a community project. \r\n\r\n### Related Pages\r\n\r\nAt the time being DINO Token has an active Medium page where the latest news and articles about the token and its ecosystem are released on a regular basis. \r\n\r\n[Medium](https://dino-token.medium.com/) \r\n\r\n### Where Can I Buy DINO Token (DINO)?\r\n\r\nCurrently DINO token  is available on the Pancakeswap Decentralized Exchange, with cryptocurrency and BUSD and USDT pairs currently available.\r\n\r\n[Pancakeswap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x3b11D489411BF11e843Cb28f8824dedBfcB75Df3&inputCurrency=BNB) offering pairs with BNB and other cryptocurrencies and stable coins.", "dateAdded": "2021-03-16T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "221", "dateLaunched": "2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["http://www.dino.surge.sh"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x3b11d489411bf11e843cb28f8824dedbfcb75df3"], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://dino-token.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/dinotoken"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/dino_token"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x3b11d489411bf11e843cb28f8824dedbfcb75df3", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x3b11d489411bf11e843cb28f8824dedbfcb75df3", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.10354213653963, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.65194998, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.06568904}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.20921272842714, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.38890528, "priceChangePercentage7d": 21.01884371}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04645557032689, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.52906873, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.09673529}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.33931138166303, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.16858519, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.79823054}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08930326229174, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.12865104, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.30358911}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34455836345464, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.68352093, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.08919521}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.58630853378085, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.7930536, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.14130451}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12843118465834, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.0847086, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.21234214}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05033196197757, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.1273618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.77452442}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:30:22.672Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "13", "credit_count": 0}}
