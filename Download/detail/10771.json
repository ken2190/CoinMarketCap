With our 3 first-in-the-world applications - Cannumo GrowFunding, Cannumo CBD and Cannumo Wallet, we will revolutionize the whole Cannabis and Crypto.\n\nVia Cannumo Growfunding, people can invest from 100$ into our Cannumo containers and after 4-6 months take out their interest rate. No need to have any knowledge at all in the Cannabis or Cryptocurrency space.\n\nvia Cannumo CBD application, you can become a CBD seller in 15 minutes. Current Cannabis market in US and europe is over 300B (billion) US$ combined. If you want to become a CBD product seller, you need to spend at least 6-12 months taking out licensing, at least 500k of paying fees, lawyers and etc. With our application, you can become a seller in 15 minutes - install our plugin into an e-commerce store, select from our different range of products, put your own labeling and that is it!\n\nAnd Cannumo Wallet, which finishes our Cannumo Ecosystem, fixes a huge error in the current markt - most of the third party payment gateway providers shy away from accepting payments from cannabis sellers to this day. If a business somehow manages to integrate a provider, that business is deemed as a \u201crisk group\u201d and the fees for every transaction reaches up to a 10% margin. A Wallet is a type of software solution, which acts as an alternative to such known issues. While carrying this application, you won\u2019t stumble upon a third party payment gateway.\n\nContrarily, Cannumo Wallet lets you sell CBD products in a more lenient way. You may employ our CANU token, which will help you avoid big commission rates, and herein the fees shall be maintained at their lowest in the e-commerce market. Therefore, the Wallet application offers a payment gateway solution for everyone in a growing cannabis industry.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-27T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:53:26.000Z", "watchCount": "2346", "dateLaunched": "2021-07-13T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.03, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://cannumo.io"], "technical_doc": ["https://cannumo.gitbook.io/cannumo-white-paper/"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xdbb66eb9f4d737b49ae5cd4de25e6c8da8b034f9"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": [], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/cannumogroup"]}, "volume": 169322.58048168, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -50.1442, "statistics": {"price": 0.01880959453266, "priceChangePercentage1h": 2.02519026, "priceChangePercentage24h": -20.8562699, "priceChangePercentage7d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage30d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 13088342.24, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 695833300.0, "maxSupply": 695833300.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 3262, "roi": -37.30135156, "low24h": 0.01773127, "high24h": 0.02470639, "low7d": 0.01145166, "high7d": 0.06815446, "low30d": 0.01145166, "high30d": 0.06815446, "low90d": 0.01145166, "high90d": 0.06815446, "low52w": 0.01145166, "high52w": 0.06815446, "lowAllTime": 0.01145166, "highAllTime": 0.06815446, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 64.25, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -72.4, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-28T21:07:05.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-27T07:27:06.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.01820573, "highYesterday": 0.0247929, "openYesterday": 0.02271613, "closeYesterday": 0.0197013, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -13.27, "volumeYesterday": 394607.4, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xdbb66eb9f4d737b49ae5cd4de25e6c8da8b034f9", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xdbb66eb9f4d737b49ae5cd4de25e6c8da8b034f9", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.12397158004247, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97590292, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.19688347}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33596831027774, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.77734443, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.79969763}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04605728182659, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.76071574, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.45447194}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35280381875814, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.16080009, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.18888228}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08800314377561, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.64715236, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.51409252}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34857459897508, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.72113979, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.05438462}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.82595372878242, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.87423756, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.88312147}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884161896118, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.72652786, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.98011293}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0504277483724, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.40139621, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.86305219}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:54:45.671Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
