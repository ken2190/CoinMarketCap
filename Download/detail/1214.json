{"data": {"id": 1214, "name": "Lisk", "symbol": "LSK", "slug": "lisk", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Lisk (LSK)?\n\nLisk is a blockchain application platform aiming to create an accessible future where everyone can benefit from decentralized technology. \n\nLisk enables developers to build applications as well as deploy a side-chain linked to the Lisk network that includes a custom token. Lisk empowers developers with a software development kit for blockchain applications and is working on an interoperability solution that will in turn let everyone seamlessly use it on the platform. \n\nLisk\u2019s ICO launched on May 24, 2016 and was built through JavaScript and TypeScript. Its main products are Core, SDK, Desktop and Mobile. With a team size of 30, it has a development contractor known as Lightcurve GmbH. The company is based in Zug, Switzerland and it is a non-profit foundation. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Lisk?\n\nThe founders of Lisk are Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows, who started the project in 2017. \n\nMax Kordek is the president of Lisk and is responsible for the strategy and business of Lisk. He is also the co-founder and director of Lightcurve, and is responsible for strategy and business there as well. Lightcurve is a blockchain product development studio and consultancy with a special focus on marketing, coding and support. \n\nThe most important client is Lisk, where Lightcurve is developing the ecosystem and plays a huge role.\n\nOliver Beddows is the vice president of Lisk and is the director of Lightcurve.\n\nBoth of them specialize in decentralized applications, Bitcoin and blockchain consulting, startup consulting, UI/UX consulting and community management. \n\n\n### What Makes Lisk Unique?\n\nImagine a world where just about anyone can benefit from using blockchain technology. With that idea in mind, the Lisk foundation targeted one very specific goal, and that is to inspire blockchain developers and enthusiasts from all around the globe. \n\nLisk is a decentralized network, similar to BitShares, Nxt or Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Lisk does not utilize [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) like Bitcoin does, and instead uses a simplified implementation of BitShares\u2019 original consensus algorithm that is known as [delegated proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos). \n\nEvery LSK holder can vote for mainchain delegates that are securing the network itself. There are 101 active mainchain delegates that always get the highest votes, and they can earn block generation rewards. All other delegates are on standby waiting to become elected or secure a Lisk sidechain. Lisk is also a cryptocurrency called LSK and it is also a framework known as the Lisk LSK SDK. You can use it to deploy your own sidechains and develop blockchain applications on top of them.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nFind out about [Band Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/band-protocol/)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Find out about [COTI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/coti/).</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Learn more about cryptocurrency with [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/9-things-to-know-before-investing-in-cryptocurrency).</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Stay in the crypto-loop on the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).</span>\n\n\n### How Many Lisk (LSK) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nLisk is priced at $1.39 USD and has a trading volume of $18,935,216 USD. When it comes to its rank, it is at #115 with a cap of $177,206,064 USD.\n\nWhen it comes to Lisk\u2019s circulating supply, it is 127,184,283 LSK coins with a total supply of 143,119,521 LSK coins. The maximum supply is unavailable.\n\nThis data is as of February 2021.\n\n\n## How Is the Lisk Network Secured?\n\nThe Lisk Network is operated using a highly efficient delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model that is secured by democratically elected delegates.\n\nThe delegated proof-of-stake is a consensus protocol that provides dependable verification and approval of transactions in a blockchain.\n\nIt essentially allows blockchains to change network parameters and free schedules, transaction sizes and block intervals, all of which does not create a hard fork, assuming the elected delegates do not vote for this kind of change.\n\nIn line with the high-security standard, Lisk also implements an external security audit that is conducted by Least Authority of Lisk SDK 5.0.0 and the Lisk Core 3.0.0. This includes work completed as part of the Network Longevity phase of the roadmap. \n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Lisk (LSK)?\n\nLisk coins can be purchased, traded and sold on the following
