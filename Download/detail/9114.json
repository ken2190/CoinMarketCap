{"data": {"id": 9114, "name": "\u03c4Bitcoin", "symbol": "\u03a4BTC", "slug": "t-bitcoin", "category": "token", "description": "## The \u03c4 Protocol\r\n\r\nThe \u03c4 protocol describes how PoW cryptocurrencies can be reliably synthesized for\r\nfurther use or composition by DeFi instruments. We refer to PoW cryptocurrencies\r\nsynthesized by the \u03c4 protocol as \u03c4Assets. To ensure \u03c4Assets have inherent value, the\r\n\u03c4 protocol requires consumption of hashrate during synthesis. In other words, the \u03c4\r\nprotocol does not synthesize PoW cryptocurrencies directly. It synthesizes the\r\nmining process, which secures the value of PoW assets in general. And to restore the\r\nprice pegs when the relative price is lower than 1.0, the \u03c4 protocol uses a\r\ncombination of deflationary rebasing and open-market purchases to improve\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\n## Synthetic Mining\r\n\r\nThe \u03c4 protocol utilizes hashrate tokens to synthesize the mining process. Hashrate\r\ntokens are cryptocurrencies collateralized by standardized and tokenized PoW\r\nhashrate. Staking hashrate tokens would entitle the staking holder to a share of the\r\nmining rewards earned by the underlying PoW hashrate.\r\nTo synthesize a \u03c4Assets, the \u03c4 protocol requires the staking of hashrate tokens\r\ncollateralized by the relevant PoW hashrate and the forgoing of PoW rewards in\r\nreturn for the synthetic versions. For example, synthesis of \u03c4Bitcoin would require\r\nsynthetic mining with hashrate tokens collateralized by standardized Bitcoin\r\nhashrate. The combination of staking with the relevant PoW hashrate and the\r\nsurrendering of PoW rewards represent hashrate consumption, imparting inherent\r\nvalue into the resultant synthetics.\r\nThe forgone mining rewards will be reserved for open market repurchases of\r\n\u03c4Assets, if necessary, as discussed below.\r\n\r\n## Inflationary Mining\r\n\r\nWhen the relative price of a \u03c4Asset is greater than 1.0 (determined daily as the\r\naverage relative price of the previous day), the \u03c4 protocol would adjust the synthetic\r\ndifficulty such that additional units of the \u03c4Asset become minable through synthetic\r\nmining. The greater the price deviation is, the stronger the adjustment would be.\r\nInflationary synthetic mining will continue until the increase in total supply restores\r\nthe relative price of the \u03c4Asset to 1.0.\r\nA special case is the launch period of a \u03c4Asset. Because the initial supply of a \u03c4Asset\r\nis zero, there is no relative price available to determine synthetic difficulty with. To\r\nsolve this issue and as a convention, the inflationary mining mechanism will be\r\npaused during the first weeks of a \u03c4Asset\u2019s launch. During this initial period, a fixed\r\namount of \u03c4Asset consisting of initial circulation should be minable regardless of the\r\nrelative price. The initial circulation amount for a \u03c4Asset should be proportionate to\r\nthe percentage of blockchain-wide PoW hashrate represented by the relevant\r\nhashrate tokens to avoid acute deflationary pressure.\r\n\r\n## \u03c4Bitcoin\r\n\r\n\u03c4Bitcoin brings Bitcoin to DeFi and its price will be 1:1 pegged to that of Bitcoin. Backed by institutional miners representing 12% of Bitcoin\u2019s global hashrate, \u03c4Bitcoin will be a synthetic Bitcoin uniquely suitable for DeFi use cases.\r\n\r\nTotal initial liquidity of \u03c4Bitcoin is proposed to be set at 2,100.\r\nHere are launch parameters of \u03c4Bitcoin initial liquidity event proposed; all time intervals are approximated by block accounts:\r\n* Earned by staking BTCSTs: 1,050 (50.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly (determined by block counts).\r\n* Earned by staking BTCBs: 21 (1.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\r\n* Earned by staking \u03c4Bitcoins: 84 (4%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\r\n\r\nAirdrop parameters of \u03c4Bitcoin proposed; all time intervals are approximated by block accounts:\r\n* One-time airdrop to PancakeSwap Syrup Pool: 10.5 (0.5%); distributed following Syrup Pool rules; users may visit PancakeSwap\u2019s syrup pool to claim syrup pool airdrops.\r\n* Airdropped to PancakeSwap BTCST-BNB Liquidity Providers: 10.5 (0.5%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly; to be eligible for a week\u2019s BTCST-BNB LP airdrop, a user must be a BTCST-BNB LP on PancakeSwap for the preceding week and maintained at least USD 1000 in BTCST-BNB liquidity; the amount of tBitcoin airdrops that a user is eligible to receive is proportional to the user\u2019s average balance of BTCST-BNB LP Tokens for the preceding week.\r\n* Airdropped to BTCST holders: 84 (4%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly; to be eligible for a week\u2019s BTCST Holder airdrop, a user must hold BTCST in a personal wallet (exchange accounts and other similar custodian accounts are ineligible for the airdrops) for the preceding week and maintained at least USD 1000 of average BTCST balance; the amount of BTCST Holder airdrops that a user is eligible to receive is proportional to the user\u2019s average balance of BTCSTs for the preceding week.\r\n* BTCST\u2019s new version of dApp will feature an Airdrop page to allow users to connect their wallets to view and claim BTCST-BNB and BTCST Holder airdrops.\r\n\r\n\u03c4Asset treasury will reserve 840 (40%) of \u03c4Bitcoin\u2019s initial liquidity for community grants and other ecosystem building purposes.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime":
