{"data": {"id": 9692, "name": "CatzCoin", "symbol": "CATZ", "slug": "catzcoin", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is CatzCoin (CATZ)?\r\n\r\nLaunched on 1 May 2021 by a team based in Australia, CatzCoin ($CATZ) is a community token that connects cat fans from all over the world. CatzCoin will focus on the development of a number of cat related initiatives as detailed out in the roadmap. \r\n\r\nThere is no pre-sale, no investor, and no pre-mine. Furthermore, the initial project liquidity has been locked on Unicrypt. So from the beginning, $CATZ has been a product built for cat lovers. Our motto is \u201cby the Catz, for the Catz\u201d and always will be.\r\n\r\nCentral to the Catz mission is the goal of helping out homeless cats. Over the next 30 months, CatzCoin will be donating 5% of the total coin supply to charities that support homeless cats. CATZ holders will have the right to pick and select the charities to which the tokens will be distributed. \r\n\r\nOver the coming months and years, CatzCoin has a detailed roadmap that they plan to execute on. Key projects include a NFT tradeable platform, homeless cat charity donations, influencer collaborations, creation of a CatzSwap De-Fi platform, and eventually a Meme ETF.\r\n\r\n## How Many CATZ Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe CATZ token is used for governance, CatzSwap benefits, and voting rights. There is a capped supply of 100 billion tokens. 40% of the supply has been injected as initial liquidity (locked via UniCrypt). 20% will be used for marketing and charity. 10% are designated to future project development and another 10% has been vested to the founders of the project. The remaining 20% of the supply will be burned over a 24-month period. The burn process will occur over time, with 5% being burnt every 6 months, starting October 2021, until the total supply reduces to 80 billion tokens by the end of April 2023. \r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of CatzCoin?\r\n\r\nThe CEO of CatzCoin is William Wu, previously a Vice President at Oaktree Capital Management, one of the largest and most successfully run private equity firms in the world. Prior to Oaktree, William was at McKinsey & Company, the premier management consultancy and trusted advisor to the world\u2019s most successful corporations and governments. William holds a Master in Business Administration from the Wharton School of Business, a Master in Finance from the London School of Economics, and a Bachelor in Commerce from the University of New South Wales.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-11T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:35:24.000Z", "watchCount": "5885", "dateLaunched":
