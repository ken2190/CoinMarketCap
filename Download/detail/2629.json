{"data": {"id": 2629, "name": "Scala", "symbol": "XLA", "slug": "scala", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Scala (XLA)?\n\nScala is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project linking Web 3.0 and IPFS storage technologies to build a globally scalable and mobile-friendly ecosystem. The network runs on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism called Panthera, which is highly efficient on CPU and ARM devices.\n\nScala is fully open-source and community-driven. Anyone can discuss, influence, or work on its development through the [Community Contribution System (CCS)](https://trello.com/b/rsAwcpJN/scala-ccs).\n\nXLA is the native utility coin that is used for:\n\n* Fees for processing transactions and storing data\n* Rewarding miners for their contribution to securing the network\n* Enabling features in Scala\u2019s applications ecosystem\n\nScala applications include: \n\n* [Scala Share](https://share.scalaproject.io/) which is a decentralized and IPFS-based file sharing tool\n* [Android Miner](https://mobileminer.scalaproject.io/) that allows any mobile device to mine XLA and get mining rewards \n* GUI, CLI and mobile wallets to easily store, send and receive XLA on any platform\n* [Network Explorer](https://explorer.scalaproject.io/) to provide information about transactions and the understanding of network performance\n* Diardi, which is Scala\u2019s custom light delayed proof-of-work implementation built on IPFS, that provides security to the network\n\n\n## How Many XLA Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nScala launched its mainnet on January 22, 2018. It was called \u201cStellite\u201d back then, with a max supply of 21 billion coins. It was renamed to \u201cScala\u201d on August 13, 2019 due to trademark issues with the name \u201cStellite\u201d. 25% of the block reward goes to the Diardi node maintainers for the maintenance and support of the IPFS-based nodes which are the cornerstone of Scala\u2019s network security. On July 31, 2020, Scala moved away from a capped supply to an infinite supply with a tail emission, to ensure the sustainability and growth of the project over time.\n\n\n## What is the Diardi protocol?\n\nScala has implemented a light version of the Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) protocol that they called Diardi, which is the backbone of their network security.\n\nEssentially, dPoW checkpoints the daemons blocks onto another stronger chain (like Bitcoin). Deriving from the ideas of dPoW, Scala implemented their own version of dPoW which doesn\u2019t use any other blockchain. Instead, their variant (Diardi) uses the same database as that of their own blockchain. This is made possible by a system utilizing IPFS and the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database Manager (LMDB).\n\nScala is one of the first projects in the world \u2013 if not the only one! \u2013 to use IPFS in a way that impacts the actual consensus of the blockchain, providing an additional layer of security against threats such as 51% attacks.\n\nWatch the [IPFS meetup presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug8mpkVaOOM) for more information about this innovative solution.\n\n\n## Is it possible to mine XLA on a mobile device?\n\nYes! Scala\u2019s Proof of Work algorithm provides resistance against specialized hardware and GPUs, which allows smaller miners to be profitable.\n\nThis algorithm is able to run on any CPU regardless of architecture, but it performs exceptionally well on ARM (mobile) processors in comparison to Intel/AMD, keeping power efficiency as a factor. \n\nScala developed their own customized temperature calculation algorithm (AMAYC) that uses novel Machine Learning functions to keep phones mining in safe temperatures, and even implements a static temperature control layer to protect the device from overheating.\n\nScala\u2019s [Android Miner](https://mobileminer.scalaproject.io/) is the reference for real mobile mining, and has been forked numerous times by other cryptocurrency projects.\n\n\n## What is Scala Share?\n\n[Scala Share](https://share.scalaproject.io/) is a secure, fast and decentralized content delivery network (CDN) that allows users to easily upload and share files. It uses Scala's Diardi nodes to pin files ephemerally and ensure storage space for a certain period of time. The underlying IPFS technology ensures decentralization and security. It is open source, easily scalable and fast.\n\n\n## Related Pages\n\nLearn more about Scala [here](https://wiki.scalaproject.io/).\n\nWatch a presentation about the Scala Mobile Miner [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjGgSdId77Y).\n\nDownload Scala Mobile Miner [here](https://mobileminer.scalaproject.io/).\n\nUse [Scala Share](https://share.scalaproject.io/) to upload any file safely and freely.", "dateAdded": "2018-04-09T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T08:45:44.000Z", "watchCount": "5129", "launchPrice": 0.00144237, "tags": [{"slug": "mineable", "name": "Mineable", "category": "OTHER"}, {"slug": "privacy", "name": "Privacy", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "selfReportedTags": ["Medium of Exchange", "Hybrid - dPoW & PoW", "Mobile", "Payments", "Wallet", "Storage", "Privacy"], "urls": {"website": ["https://scalaproject.io/"], "technical_doc": ["https://wiki.scalaproject.io/"], "explorer": ["https://explorer.scalaproject.io/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/scala-network"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/scala-network"], "chat": ["https://t.me/scalaofficial", "https://discord.gg/djAFVvy"], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5275597"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/ScalaHQ"]}, "volume": 3155.60340518, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -58.3592, "statistics": {"price": 0.00037067011193, "priceChangePercentage1h": -5.41393001, "priceChangePercentage24h": -6.3285191, "priceChangePercentage7d": 7.28390238, "priceChangePercentage30d": 8.88547595, "priceChangePercentage60d": -40.88155596, "priceChangePercentage90d": -71.43126577, "marketCap": 3781650.23, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": -6.3285, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 5190196.66, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 69.98, "circulatingSupply": 10202198968.45, "totalSupply": 14002198968.45, "marketCapDominance": 0.0002, "rank": 1181, "roi": -74.30131576, "low24h": 0.00036399, "high24h": 0.00040282, "low7d": 0.00032751, "high7d": 0.00044638, "low30d": 0.00027398, "high30d": 0.00046509, "low90d": 0.00023463, "high90d": 0.00291901, "low52w": 3.269e-05, "high52w": 0.003449, "lowAllTime": 1.355e-05, "highAllTime": 0.003449, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 2635.57, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -89.25, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2020-03-13T02:24:07.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-04-24T18:25:07.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00036776, "highYesterday": 0.00042023, "openYesterday": 0.00038735, "closeYesterday": 0.00037271, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -3.78, "volumeYesterday": 5384.68, "turnover": 0.00083445, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 182.6522}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 799, "name": "SmileyCoin", "slug": "smileycoin", "price": 3.893358968e-05, "priceChangePercentage24h": -2.83610007, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.67625793}, {"id": 4978, "name": "Wownero", "slug": "wownero", "price": 0.22289569794554, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.09442732, "priceChangePercentage7d": 40.98714869}, {"id": 4191, "name": "Syntropy", "slug": "syntropy", "price": 0.23713651681871, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.95880209, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.80310979}, {"id": 3599, "name": "EtherInc", "slug": "etherinc", "price": 0.00048627994027, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.02980898, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.08981252}, {"id": 5258, "name": "APIX", "slug": "apix", "price": 0.0267220377015, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.61883041, "priceChangePercentage7d": 5.36226852}, {"id": 1, "name": "Bitcoin", "slug": "bitcoin", "price": 41692.59477772826, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.00815164, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.00040407}, {"id": 5255, "name": "LegalBlock", "slug": "legalblock", "price": 0.00071609677517, "priceChangePercentage24h": -0.02850221, "priceChangePercentage7d": -10.31443011}, {"id": 6822, "name": "DistX", "slug": "distx", "price": 0.00048265736239, "priceChangePercentage24h": -8.0484186, "priceChangePercentage7d": -27.04916355}, {"id": 7684, "name": "ORO", "slug": "oro", "price": 0.09667687913563, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.72063099, "priceChangePercentage7d": 61.33452155}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T08:47:01.757Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
