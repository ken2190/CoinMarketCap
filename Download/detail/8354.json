Are funds SAFU or SNAFU? Is Bitcoin your safeword? \n\nHere is the tl;dr of the $GAMESTONK 2 STRONK SQUEEZE - When your broker is as reliable as a Cyberpunk 2077 launch day patch, does the GAME have to STOP? #cwutididthere\n\nR/wallstreetbets, also known as WallStreetBets or WSB, is a subreddit where participants discuss stock and option trading. It has become notable for its profane nature, aggressive trading strategies, and role in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze.\n\nThe subreddit, describing itself through the tagline \"Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal\",[2] is known for its aggressive trading strategies, which primarily revolve around highly speculative, leveraged options trading. Members of the subreddit are often young retail traders and investors who ignore fundamental investment practices and risk management techniques, so their activity is considered gambling. The growing popularity of no-commission brokers and mobile online trading has potentially contributed to the growth of such trading trends. Members of the communities often see high-risk day trading as an opportunity to quickly improve their financial conditions and obtain additional income. Some of the members tend to use borrowed capital, like student loans, to bet on certain \"meme stocks\" that show popularity within the community.[1][3][4][5][6]\n\nThe subreddit is also known for its profane and juvenile nature, with members often referring to themselves as \"autists\" and \"degenerates.\"[5][7]\n\n\n## [History: The GameStop Short Squeeze ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/gamestop-share-price-surges-as-crypto-exchange-lists-stock-and-elon-musk-weighs-in)\n\nOn January 22, 2021, users of r/WallStreetBets initiated a short squeeze on GameStop, pushing their stock prices up significantly. This occurred shortly after a comment from Citron Research predicting the value of the stock would decrease.[8] The stock price increased more than 600% by January 26, and its high volatility caused trading to be halted multiple times.[9][10]\n\nOn January 24, a moderator of r/WallStreetBets wrote a post stating: \"There is NO organized effort by those [of] us who moderate this community to promote, advise or recommend any stock. It is against our policy to do so and we feel it is crucial to allow members to be able to share their ideas amongst each other with autonomy.\"[11]\n\nAfter the GameStop stock closed up 92.7% on Tuesday, January 26, business magnate Elon Musk tweeted out a link to the r/WallStreetBets subreddit.[12]\n\nOn January 27, r/WallStreetBets users triggered a short squeeze on AMC, a company in a similar position to GameStop.[13]\n\nOn January 27, the official WallStreetBets Discord server was banned for \"hateful and discriminatory content\". Discord denied that the ban was related to the ongoing GameStop short squeeze.[14] In an official statement posted to the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, moderators claimed that their efforts to automatically delete content that violated rules had been overwhelmed by the sheer influx of users and the use of obscure Unicode characters, and criticized Discord for not providing the tools needed to take action to curtail hate speech on the server.[15] This was shortly followed by the subreddit being switched to private by the moderators at around 7:00 p.m. EST, before being made public again around an hour later.[16] Within one week of the GameStop short squeeze, the subreddit had gained over 2.4 million new subscribers, whereas it took 9 years to reach 2.2 million.[17] As of January 28, the WallStreetBets Discord server is online.\n\n\n## Effect on the Robinhood Trading Platform \n\nMany members of the subreddit use the popular mobile app Robinhood to trade stocks and options. Some members have been responsible for significant feature removals and bug fixes after identifying and publishing methods of exploit.[18]\n\n\n## Robinhood Restricts Trading \n\nOn January 28, 2021, in response to r/wallstreetbets's involvement in the GameStop short squeeze, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and Webull restricted the trade of heavily shorted stocks such as GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry Limited, Nokia, and Koss Corporation on their platforms.[23]\n\n## \n\nOn January 28, 2021, in response to r/wallstreetbets's involvement in the GameStop short squeeze, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and Webull restricted the trade of heavily shorted stocks such as GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry Limited, Nokia, and Koss Corporation on their platforms.[23]\n\n#### References \n\nDavidson, Jake (October 25, 2018). \"Meet the Bros Behind /r/WallStreetBets, Who Lose Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars in a Day\u2014And Brag About It\".
