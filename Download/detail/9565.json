{"data": {"id": 9565, "name": "Arise Finance", "symbol": "ARI", "slug": "arise-finance", "category": "token", "description": "ARI is not only the heart of our ecosystem, it is a governance token, a farming token to open NFTs, and also will be a ticket to IDO launchpad for ARISErs in the next few months.\r\nMost importantly, we aim to deliver long-term and sustainable profits to $ARI holders. Therefore, we have deployed 3 core functions to ensure your profitability:\r\n\r\n1/ TOKEN BURN MECHANISIM+ BUY BACK & BURN\r\n\r\nARI is a Deflationary token not only through buy back & burn by our team but also through the reduction in circulating supply. For every transaction, you must set the slippage to 4%, 2% fee of every ARI transaction will be added to liquidity and locked there forever. That means circulating supply will only go down and liquidity will go up in the future to minimize the impact of whale dumping. Once ARI DEX is launched, the core team will buy back & burn ARI token using the trading fee.\r\n\r\n2/ EARN INTERESTS WITHOUT STAKING\r\n\r\nAs we said above, Every transaction costs 4% fee, 2% of which will be burnt forever, the other 2% will be distributed to holders, so that you can earn a portion of 2% fee as PASSIVE INCOME divided between our happy holders\r\n\r\n3/ ARI RETIREMENT VAULT & TREASURY\r\n\r\nEarn even more $ARI via our farming dApp, supporting both 1-sided staking ($ARI), and pair staking ($ARI with other tokens or with stable coins) with high APY.\r\nBesides, you can also earn the retirement Bitcoin with our Retirement Yield algorithm by staking, locking $ARI, and redeeming your rewards weekly or monthly.\r\nYou\u2019ll be able to click on \u201cBTC Retirement fund\u201d and retrieve a portion of the BTC based on how long you have staked and your percentage of ARI staked within the pool. The more ARI that you have staked the more BTC you are entitled to.The longer you lock your ARI, the more interest you will earn.\r\nOur token is designed to increase in value, the more people stake their tokens in the yield farming dApp, the more transactions there are, therefore reducing circulating supply while increasing $ARI value.\r\nTo ensure sustainable growth of the project, we create a skin-in-the-game mechanism by charging a 10% fee for every unstaking transaction. 5% penalty fee will be used to buy Bitcoin (BTC) to provide for the Retirement funds, the other 5% will be sent to the ARI Treasury for prolonged emissions for the vaults and future developments.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-04T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime":
