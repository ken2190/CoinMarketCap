{"data": {"id": 3718, "name": "BitTorrent", "symbol": "BTT", "slug": "bittorrent", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is BitTorrent (BTT)?\n\nBitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) file sharing and torrent platform which has become increasingly decentralized in recent years. \n\nOriginally released in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) in July 2018. \n\nSince its acquisition, BitTorrent has added various new tools, with a dedicated native cryptocurrency token, BTT, released in February 2019. BTT was launched on TRON\u2019s own blockchain, using its TRC-10 standard.\n\nAccording to its official literature, BitTorrent is currently the \u201clargest decentralized P2P communications protocol\u201d in the world.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of BitTorrent?\n\nThe original BitTorrent is the brainchild of Bram Cohen, a developer and entrepreneur who himself has since become well known in the cryptocurrency arena.\n\nCohen has explained that he designed BitTorrent to usurp the dated entertainment industry, which made obtaining material slow and expensive. \n\nThe platform has seen multiple legal battles, with Cohen maintaining that it does not break copyright laws in allowing users to share files such as music and movies among themselves.\n\nIn 2018, TRON completed its acquisition of BitTorrent, bringing BitTorrent under the control of Justin Sun. Sun is notorious for his plugging of both TRON as a cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology, bidding $4.5 million at a charity auction to have lunch with Warren Buffett (well-known anti-crypto figure) and discuss cryptocurrency with him.\n\nTRON is also behind the addition of cryptocurrency to BitTorrent, as the BTT token was released on TRON\u2019s blockchain. The move formed part of TRON\u2019s efforts to add further decentralized features to the platform. \n\n\n#### What Makes BitTorrent Unique?\n\nBitTorrent\u2019s original goal was to disrupt the legacy entertainment industry and how consumers obtain content. \n\nExpensive and inefficient distribution networks were the main target, with original developer Bram Cohen seeing benefits in allowing internet users to distribute content among themselves directly.\n\nIn the early 2000s, BitTorrent became the go-to P2P file sharing platform, with TRON stepping in 2018. \n\nUnder TRON, BitTorrent has expanded its user appeal to those interested in decentralized solutions and cryptocurrency, as well as to its own user base. \n\nAmong the added features are BitTorrent Speed, which uses the BTT token as part of its operations.\n\nBitTorrent has also branched out into paid services, offering several \u201cpremium\u201d versions of its platform which include VPN capabilities and ad-free browsing.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about Upfiring [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/upfiring/).\n\nRead more about AXEL [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axel/).\n\nNew to crypto?

The BitTorrent team and umbrella organization, the BitTorrent Foundation, were awarded 19% of the supply. The TRON foundation holds 20%, with 19.9% going to the BitTorrent ecosystem itself.\n\nA final 4% of tokens are reserved for partnership activities.\n\nBTT plays various roles in BitTorrent\u2019s products, including allowing users to pay others for faster downloads with BitTorrent Speed.\n\n\n### How Is the BitTorrent Network Secured?\n\nBitTorrent says that it employs \u201cthe highest level of security measures\u201d in order to secure user funds, but advises that cryptocurrency involves inherent risk.\n\nThe company recommends that users protect themselves against theft, in the form of malware or similar programs, by using options such as biometric verification.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy BitTorrent (BTT)?\n\nBTT is tradable for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and even fiat currencies on major exchanges. [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) are among the offerings. \n\nTo find out more about how to buy [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC) or any other cryptocurrency, read CoinMarketCap\u2019s [easy
