{"data": {"id": 7743, "name": "Ethereum Yield", "symbol": "ETHY", "slug": "ethereum-yield", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Ethereum Yield (ETHY)?\n\nEthereum Yield (ETHY) is a [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) protocol and token built on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. The noninflationary ETHY, an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, can be staked to generate returns. Those who stake on the platform are rewarded with the profits from transaction fees, and periodic token buybacks will redistribute ETHY to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider).\n\nEthereum Yield was both [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ethereum-yield-ethy-ready-to-launch-in-defi-zone) and [launched](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1331035887078141953) in November 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Ethereum Yield?\n\nThe development team behind Ethereum Yield has remained largely anonymous, although one developer publicly [identified](https://medium.com/realsatoshiclub/ethereum-yield-x-satoshiclub-ama-from-19-november-e8fbf91ba640) himself as Liao Fu during an \"ask me anything\" session. During the Q&A, Fu stated that the team will be working with majority ETHY holders to jointly govern the project.\n\n\n#### What Makes Ethereum Yield Unique?\n\nEthereum Yield has referred to itself as \"Ethereum's powerful Yield farming coin,\" stating that it's designed to maximize returns, reward holders and punish \"weak hands.\" According to its announcement, when users stake [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) liquidity provider tokens, a percentage of incurred fees are used for price-pumping actions such as liquidating LP tokens and buying back ETHY. The project designed ETHY to be noninflationary, so every time a token is transferred, a fee is charged and awarded to the farmers.\n\nThe project relies on [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool), called EVaults, that execute strategies on deposited tokens and are [designed](https://docs.ethereumyield.farm/evaults.html) to maintain the value of ETHY and maximize returns for liquidity providers.\n\nIn December 2020, Ethereum Yield [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ethereum-stake-ready-to-launch-in-defi-zone-eth2-validator) that it would be launching [Ethereum Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-stake/) (ETHS), which will enable more advanced staking such as [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) validator [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking). It has also [unveiled](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1332464373131042819) a custom aggregator and that it will be [adding](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1331039350134599680) a [Dai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) (DAI) farming pool.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [cVault.finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cvault-finance/), another Ethereum-based deflationary yield farming project.\n\nLearn about [Ethereum Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-stake/), the advanced staking project launched by the Ethereum Yield team.\n\nHow does yield farming work? Read an [in-depth guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on DeFi, yield farming and more with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Ethereum Yield (ETHY) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nEthereum Yield has a fixed [supply](https://docs.ethereumyield.farm/tokenomics.html) of 500,000 ETHY. There is no built-in mechanism to mint new tokens beyond this amount. The supply was [allocated](https://medium.com/realsatoshiclub/ethereum-yield-x-satoshiclub-ama-from-19-november-e8fbf91ba640) in the following manner: 100,000 ETHY (20%) for a public presale, 375,000 ETHY (75%) for farming rewards and 25,000 (5%) ETHY for the development team.\n\nIn November 2020, the project [held](https://docs.ethereumyield.farm/presale.html) its token presale during which 100,000 ETHY was available for purchase, [locking in](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1330668759611273216) around $1 million in [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) on Uniswap. Shortly afterward, the development team [announced](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1331297937184452608) that it would buy back 150 [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) worth of ETHY with private funds. It later [said](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1336860061788991490) that it had burned a total of 9,000 ETHY.\n\n\n### How Is the Ethereum Yield Network Secured?\n\nEthereum Yield is an ERC-20 token, which means that it relies on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) to validate ETHY transactions. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nThe project was launched with centralized governance, but it has stated ETHY token holders will be able to participate in governance and make decisions regarding developer fees, liquidity pools, etc. Despite its centralization, the project has [stated](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1333804824111026176) that its liquidity pools cannot be exploited by the development team because its liquidity is indefinitely locked up in Uniswap. In addition, the team has [renounced](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1332419424922578945) ownership over the staking [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).\n\nEthereum Yield's smart contracts were [audited](https://certik.foundation/vendors/ethereum%20yield) by blockchain cybersecurity firm CertiK in November 2020. The audit found no major security vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Ethereum Yield (ETHY)?\n\nETHY is primarily exchanged on [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), although it is also listed on [1Inch Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/1inch-exchange/). It can be traded against [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) (WETH) and [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether) (USDT).\n\nAre you interested in buying ETHY or other [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC)? CoinMarketCap has a simple, [step-by-step guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to teach you all about crypto and how to buy your first coins.\n", "dateAdded":
