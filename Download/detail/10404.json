{"data": {"id": 10404, "name": "Integral", "symbol": "ITGR", "slug": "integral", "category": "token", "description": "What is Integral?\r\n\r\nIntegral is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol and exchange that mirror liquidity on other top exchanges. In its final form, Integral aims to provide the cheapest liquidity among all centralized and decentralized exchanges. \r\n\r\nThese features are made possible with the technology of Concentrated Liquidity and Trade Delay. Concentrated Liquidity enables Integral to achieve the best execution costs in DeFi per dollar of TVL. With just a fraction of the TVL of its competitors' corresponding pools, Integral can achieve an equivalent level of liquidity and price impact. Trade Delay prevents front-running/cross-exchange arbitrageurs, giving LPs of Integral Mean-0 IL. \r\n\r\nIntegral\u2019s smart contract operates as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Integral?\r\n\r\nIntegral is a team of mathematicians, engineers, growth hackers working with the Ethereum and DeFi OG community. Its current advisors include Robert Leshner (Founder of Compound), Tarun Chitra (Founder of Gauntlet), Framework Ventures and Polychain Capital.\r\n\r\nThe team sticks true to DeFi principles. Before the Public Seed Round, it was completely self-funded and had now pre-sale. The only outside funding is from Gitcoin donations (#1 in GR9 dApp).\r\n\r\nThe team announced in May 2021 that it had successfully closed its $32mm Public Seed Round.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Integral Unique?\r\n\r\nIntegral is the pioneer of Concentrated Liquidity in DeFi. Its innovative OB-AMM enables Integral to unbundle the concept of liquidity to depth (orderbook depth, AMM shape) and capital (the actual amount of LP asset in the orderbook or AMM). By mirroring orderbook from exchanges like Binance and Uniswap, Integral can achieve the same depth with much less capital. \r\n\r\nIntegral coined the term \u201dImplied Liquidity\u201d to illustrate the magic of this technology and provide a benchmark for traders to understand this aspect. For example, although Integral\u2019s TVL is $180mm on June 8th 2021, it offers an equivalent level of liquidity and slippage that a $9B CFAMM (Constant Function Automatic Market Maker) pool offers, making its Implied Liquidity $9B.\r\n\r\nFor LPs, Integral uses Trade Delay and price oracle to minimize the impact of impermanent loss.\r\n\r\nLPs incur sure losses when sure-profit traders (arbitrageurs, front-running, etc.) are able to trade on DEX. But with Integral\u2019s trade delay mechanism, they can\u2019t be certain that they will make sure profits anymore, so they will trade somewhere else. This gives LPs Mean-0 IL--an IL profiles that oscillate around 0. At times this IL will even become negative, meaning it becomes more profitable to supply an asset to a pool in contrast to just holding it in the wallet.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "icoStatus": "untracked_ico", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "351", "dateLaunched": "2021-03-02T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [{"slug": "decentralized-exchange", "name": "Decentralized exchange", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "defi", "name": "DeFi", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "amm", "name": "AMM", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "dex", "name": "DEX", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://integral.link"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.integral.link/library/white-papers"], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://integral.substack.com"], "chat": ["https://discord.com/invite/GJYCF55Tb6"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/integralhq"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.93913845067335, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10541915, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.63438799}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33773955512395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.23981776, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.41715042}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04592046794645, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.23029735, "priceChangePercentage7d": 17.9758293}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08803051270921, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32754572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.77415107}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.86320486217138, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.14307618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6744906}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884102685655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.39973257, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44788409}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "ico": {"cryptoId": 10404, "cryptoSymbol": "ITGR", "status": "Ended", "cryptoStatus": 16, "name": "Integral", "statistic": {"tokensForSale": 4500000.0, "raisedInUsd": 0.0}, "stages": [{"start": "2021-06-11T04:20:04.000Z", "end": "2021-06-14T04:20:09.000Z", "status": "Ended", "type": "ICO", "tokenForSale": 4500000, "icoPriceUsd": "0.98", "personalCap": "TBA", "distributedInIcoPercentage": 300000000, "access": "Private", "comments": "https://integral.substack.com/p/integral-tge-for-listing", "fundraisingGoalUsd": "4410000", "whereToBuyName": "Gnosis", "whereToBuyUrl": "", "acceptedCurrency": ""}]}, "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:51:56.748Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
