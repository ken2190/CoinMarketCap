{"data": {"id": 2011, "name": "Tezos", "symbol": "XTZ", "slug": "tezos", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Tezos (XTZ)?\n\nTezos is a blockchain network that\u2019s based on smart contracts, in a way that\u2019s not too dissimilar to Ethereum. However, there\u2019s a big difference: Tezos aims to offer infrastructure that is more advanced \u2014 meaning it can evolve and improve over time without there ever being a danger of a hard fork. This is something that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have suffered since they were created. People who hold XTZ can vote on proposals for protocol upgrades that have been put forward by Tezos developers.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-tezos).\n\nThis open-source platform bills itself as \u201csecure, upgradable and built to last\u201d \u2014 and says its smart contract language provides the accuracy that is required for high-value use cases. According to Tezos, its approach means that it is futureproof and will \u201cremain state-of-the-art long into the future,\u201d meaning it can embrace developments in blockchain technology.\n\nThe technology underpinning Tezos was first proposed in a white paper that was released in September 2014. After a series of delays, the Tezos mainnet launched four years later.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Tezos?\n\nArthur Breitman was the man who wrote the Tezos white paper \u2014 and in a nod to [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto), he wrote his works under the pen name L. M. Goodman. He argued that one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest failings was the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from the community who use the network \u2014 as well as the fact that new tokens couldn\u2019t be issued through this blockchain.\n\nHe and his wife Kathleen founded a startup called Dynamic Ledger Solutions which was tasked with writing the code that would underpin the Tezos protocol. This company was subsequently purchased by the Tezos Foundation to ensure that it owned all of the intellectual property rights relating to the network.\n\n### What Makes Tezos Unique?\n\nAlthough staking is common across blockchains, Tezos has a unique twist on this process. Participants can get involved with the network\u2019s governance through \u201cbaking,\u201d where they effectively stake 8,000 XTZ. This creates a financial incentive to act honestly.\n\nBakers are then tasked with voting on proposed changes to the blockchain\u2019s code in a four-step procedure that takes approximately 23 days. Proposals that receive support from the vast majority of participants are put through their paces on a testnet for 48 hours and are fully implemented if they are backed by a super-majority.\n\nTezos is also unique because of how it has started to be used by high-profile businesses. In September 2020, it was announced that the French banking giant Societe Generale planned to use this blockchain for experimenting with a central bank digital currency.\n\nBig cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have also unveiled support for Tezos staking, meaning users can receive rewards based on the XTZ that they hold. This is not a feature that\u2019s seen too widely across digital assets.\n\n**Related Pages**:\n\n[Read in-depth tech deep dives on CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/tech-deep-dives)\n\n[Glossary: What is staking?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking)\n\n[Discover which cryptos have recently been added to CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/new/)\n\n[CoinMarketCap Blog: The latest features and analysis](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n[A Deep Dive Into Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-tezos)\n\n\n### How Many Tezos (XTZ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nOur data shows that 743,862,304 XTZ are in circulation at the time of writing.\n\nA token sale for Tezos was held back in July 2017 \u2014 and during this ICO, a total of 65,681 BTC and 361,122 ETH was raised. At the time, this was worth $232 million, securing its place as one of the largest initial coin offerings ever held.\n\nWhile 80% of this initial supply went to investors, 20% was split equally between the Tezos Foundation and Dynamic Ledger Solutions.\n\nThe mainnet\u2019s launch was delayed by a series of lawsuits from some disgruntled investors, who argued that XTZ amounted to unregistered securities.\n\n### How Is the Tezos Network Secured?\n\nLike other blockchains, Tezos uses a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism.\n\nAnyone can become a validator and contribute to the smooth running of the network by making a security deposit. To incentivize honest behavior, rewards are given to those who work in the best interests of the blockchain \u2014 and those who act dishonestly risk losing their stake altogether.\n\n### Where Can You Buy Tezos (XTZ)?\n\nXTZ, otherwise known as \u201ctez\u201d for short, can be purchased from most major exchanges \u2014 including Binance, Coinbase and others. Trading pairs unite XTZ with fiat currencies, as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.[ If you\u2019re looking to convert fiat into Bitcoin, you can read a comprehensive guide here.](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)\n\n### About Tezos Nodes\n\n[Tezos Nodes](https://www.tezos-nodes.com/) is a reliability rating public Tezos Bakers and a service for monitoring the state of node performance for non-public Tezos Bakers.\n\nWorking with the baking community, the team developed a baker reliability index that [features 10 key indicators](https://www.tezos-nodes.com/about).
