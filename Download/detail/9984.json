CluShare is a decentralized Binance platform which enables its users to earn a passive income by holding tokens on the platform: a staking-as-a-platform service.\n\nCluShare plans to create a decentralized exchange with a crypto gateway, as well as CluCoin (which is a coin on its own blockchain with a staking option).\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of CluCoin?\n\nThe creator of CluCoin goes by DNP3 on Twitter, and describes himself as a computer engineer, gamer and giveawayer. \n\n\n#### What Makes CluCoin Unique?\n\nCluCoin is unique due to its charity aspect. The project, CluShare, was built to stake tokens with the goal of providing a charity focus to help people around the world. There will be a dedicated charity wallet, and each month, dividends earned will be sent to the charities that have been nominated by shareholders. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/).\n\nLearn more about [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics).\n\nLearn more about [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/)<sup>.</sup>\n\nCheck out the CoinMarketCap [blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many CluCoin (CLU) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAccording to CluShare\u2019s [whitepaper](https://clucoin.com/whitepaper), there are a total of 1,000,000,000,000,000 tokens produced: one quadrillion coins. 30 trillion will be burned prior to the launch on PancakeSwap, while 200 trillion tokens are set aside for a pre-launch with a 1% bonus. 300 trillion more will be burned over 10 months, with 100 trillion in an establishment wallet, 200 trillion on PancakeSwap, 3 trillion in the charity wallet, 2 trillion on marketing and 195 trillion on exchange listing. \n\n\n### How Is the CluCoin Network Secured?\n\nThe CLU coin is a BEP-20 token, which means that it is secured on the [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) and is an extension of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20).\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy CluCoin (CLU)?\n\nAs of May 2021, crypto enthusiasts can purchase CluCoin from BKEx and DODO on Binance Smart Chain.
