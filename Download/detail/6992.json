{"data": {"id": 6992, "name": "Spartan Protocol", "symbol": "SPARTA", "slug": "spartan-protocol", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Spartan Protocol (SPARTA)?\n\nThe Spartan Protocol is intended to provide incentives for deep capital formation in liquidity pools with safe and sustainable creation of synthetic assets. It claims to be the first major liquidity project on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/bsc/)), which was chosen thanks to its near-instantaneous settlements and low gas fees. \n\nThe Spartan Protocol is a liquidity protocol for asset exchange and synthetic asset generation on the BSC; its foundation are the liquidity pools, similarly to Uniswap. Instead of a fixed-rate fee model, it uses a liquidity-sensitive fee model.\n\nThe Spartan Protocol uses elements of other well-established projects to create a platform that runs on the BSC instead of the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) network.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Spartan Protocol?\n\nThe Spartan Protocol project has been developed in a decentralized manner from the moment of its inception and has no official team or treasury.\n\n\n#### What Makes Spartan Protocol Unique?\n\nSpartanPools are Spartan Protocol\u2019s incentivized liquidity pools that drive on-market capital formation. The liquidity pools are facilitated by an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) algorithm that has liquidity-sensitive fees. The fees are there to ensure that the system can detect correct token purchasing at all times, allowing for scalable and risk-tolerant growth.\n\nSpartanSynths is a protocol that allows for the generation of synthetic assets through the use of price anchors offered by its own liquidity pools and collateralized by liquidity pool shares. The liquidity pool shares are on-market, value-stabilized and can be instantly liquidated. Liquidity-sensitive fees ensure that positions taken up will scale with the depth of the available liquidity, preventing the deleveraging spirals that are common in many similar systems.\n\nSpartanLending works when synthetic token minters short the value of their tokens and long the value of their collateral. By winding up their position they can achieve leverage. The opposite is true for those that want to long a token with leverage. Lending is possible through the use of a system of fees and collateralized debt. The liquidation of unhealthy positions is done instantly through liquidity pools.\n\nSpartanDAO is a mechanism that is used to govern the entire ecosystem and distribute protocol incentives.\n\nSPARTA is a fixed-supply network asset that coordinates participation and incentivizes capital formation for synthetic assets and lending. The SPARTA token was initially distributed through a process known as proof-of-burn, where participants could choose to burn their assets in return for a share of the initial supply of 100,000,000 SPARTA tokens. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [WaykiChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/waykichain/).\n\nLearn more about

64,147,511 tokens and a maximum supply of 300,000,000 SPARTA as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Spartan Protocol Network Secured?\n\nSpartan Protocol is based on the Binance Smart Chain, a VM-compatible delegated proof-of-stake ([DPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) blockchain with fast block times and a focus on decentralization.\n\n\n###
