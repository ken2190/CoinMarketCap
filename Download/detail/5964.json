{"data": {"id": 5964, "name": "Trust Wallet Token", "symbol": "TWT", "slug": "trust-wallet-token", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Trust Wallet Token (TWT)?\n\nTrust Wallet Token, or TWT, is a simple BEP-20 utility token that provides a range of benefits and incentives to Trust Wallet users. Trust Wallet itself is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that supports dozens of popular native assets, in addition to popular tokens on the Ethereum, Binance and [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) blockchains.\n\nHolders of TWT tokens unlock a variety of benefits when using Trust Wallet, including discounts on in-app cryptocurrency purchases and on the use of decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) services. TWT holders can also participate in the governance of Trust Wallet and can vote on Trust Wallet update proposals, helping to shape the development of the app. \n\nTrust Wallet Token was initially launched as a BEP-2 asset on Binance Chain, but was relaunched as a BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain in October 2020.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Trust Wallet Token\n\nTrust Wallet was founded by Viktor Radchenko in 2017. Based in Mountain View, California, Radchenko previously held development and engineering roles at several tech firms, and also co-founded Trucker Path in 2013 \u2014 the company behind one of the most popular apps for truckers and logistics firms. \n\nRadchenko turned his attention to the mobile cryptocurrency wallet industry when he found that \u201capp stores did not have any open source wallets for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and ERC20 tokens.\u201d\n\nThe platform was acquired by [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) in July 2018 for an undisclosed sum, but Radchenko still works on the platform as part of the Binance team. The full [Trust Wallet team](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2218440709%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH) is not public, but it is known to comprise over 20 individuals \u2014 many of which have overlapping roles at Binance. \n\n\n## What Makes Trust Wallet Token Unique?\n\nTrust Wallet Token is a utility token designed to provide additional value to users of the Trust Wallet mobile app \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have any utility outside of the Trust Wallet ecosystem. \n\nDespite this, as a BEP-20 asset, Trust Wallet Tokens can be transferred to any wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain assets, where it may be exchanged against other assets or used as payment for services. Since it also confers voting rights and governance over the development of Trust Wallet and can be used for discounted DEX trades and in-app purchases, TWT has gone on to develop value of its own as a speculative instrument. \n\nTWT was also one of the first tokens to launch on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) \u2014 a high-performance [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). As a result, TWT can be transferred with extremely low fees and near-instant transaction confirmation times. \n\n\n### Relevant Pages\n\n[Binance Coin (BNB) ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/)is the cryptocurrency that powers the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nRead about [Crypto.com Coin (CRO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crypto-com-coin/).\n\nLearn how to use a Bitcoin Wallet with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-wallet).\n\nStay on top of the market with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n## How Many Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs part of the transition to Binance Smart Chain, 99% of the original TWT token supply was burned and the new maximum supply was set at 1 billion TWT \u2014 of this, just over a quarter is currently in circulation. \n\nThe circulating supply of TWT will gradually grow as TWT tokens are earned by Trust Wallet users for completing various tasks, such as by participating in referral campaigns, taking quizzes and completing tasks within the app \u2014 like cryptocurrency [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and trading.\n\nAs per the [official source](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/trust-wallet-token-twt-listed-on-binance-dex/62145), 40% of the TWT token supply will be targeted towards user acquisition, 15% will be distributed to the Trust Wallet community, 30% will be held in reserve and 15% is allocated to developers. As of October 2020, Trust Wallet has not yet published the full tokenomics or emission schedule for the Trust Wallet Token. \n\n\n## How Is the Trust Wallet Token Network Secured?\n\nBased on Binance Smart Chain, the Trust Wallet Token is backed by a rigorously tested [proof-of-stake (POS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism. This is used to protect the network against a range of potential threats, including [51%](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) and Sybil attacks. \n\nIt\u2019s also protected by a generous bug bounty program operated by Binance, which pays up to $10,000 in BNB to anybody that discovers a vulnerability on Binance Chain and its core smart contracts. \n\nBeyond this, as a BEP-20 asset, TWT is secured by the security of the wallet software used to manage it. For Trust Wallet, this includes a passcode security lock and a 12-word recovery phrase. \n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Trust Wallet Token (TWT)?\n\nTrust Wallet Token is available to purchase and trade on a variety of platforms \u2014 including both centralized and decentralized exchanges. [MXC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mxc/) and [Binance DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-dex/) are among the most liquid exchanges for TWT. The token is currently tradable against a range of other cryptocurrencies, including [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nLooking to buy cryptocurrencies like Trust Wallet Token with fiat?
