{"data": {"id": 7395, "name": "Atari Token", "symbol": "ATRI", "slug": "atari-token", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Atari Token [ATRI]?\n\nAtari Token is a decentralized cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) blockchain. It was designed by Atari Chain Ltd. \u2014 a subsidiary of the video game and consumer electronics firm Atari Interactive \u2014 specifically for the needs of the interactive entertainment industry.\n\nAtari\u2019s plan for its ATRI token is to become a universal means of payment for the video game industry, allowing developers and publishers new options for monetization of their products, integration of smart contracts, protection of in-game assets and more.\n\nATRI became available to the public on October 30, 2020. Prior to that, it underwent three private pre-sale rounds in March-April, September and October 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Atari Token?\n\nAtari Token was founded and is continuously developed by Atari Chain Limited, a subsidiary firm of Atari created specifically for this purpose.\n\nAtari itself is one of the earliest successful video game and arcade game companies, co-founded in California in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Pong \u2014 the first commercially successful video game \u2014 was released by Atari in November 1972.\n\nThe company\u2019s Atari 2600 video game console, released in 1977, was one of the first platforms to pioneer the use of ROM cartridges \u2014 as opposed to many other consoles at the time that only supported games that were in-built into each particular console.\n\nIn 2008, Atari became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infogrames Entertainment (IESA) \u2014 currently known as Atari SA \u2014 a French holding company specialized in video games and based in Paris.\n\n\n#### What Makes Atari Token Unique?\n\nAtari Token\u2019s main target market is the interactive entertainment industry; with ATRI, Atari is aiming to create a decentralized, secure and permissionless means of transfer of value between individual players and/or video game platforms.\n\nAs of November 2020, Atari Chain Ltd. is developing its own network of smart platforms, video games and online casinos which will support deep integration with ATRI and enjoy the benefits associated with [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based decentralized cryptocurrencies. In the future, the firm plans to extend the option of ATRI integration to any platform or application in the video game industry.\n\nATRI is a fully decentralized token based on Ethereum\u2019s [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) compatibility standard. This means that it can be easily integrated with the existing infrastructure of Ethereum, such as online exchanges and wallets, allowing for entirely new use cases in the video game industry.\n\nOne possible example offered by Atari Chain itself are skill-based video games that allow players to stake ATRI tokens against each other. In this scenario, the winner would take home the combined stake and be able to immediately convert it into a different cryptocurrency or a traditional currency like the U.S. dollar on any ERC-20 compatible exchange where ATRI is listed. \n\n\n##### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about [ENJ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/enjin-coin/) \u2014 another project that aims to disrupt the video game industry through the use of crypto.\n\nCheck out CoinMarketCap\u2019s new educational platform, CMC [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics).\n\n\n##### How Many Atari Token [ATRI] Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of ATRI is limited to 7.481 billion tokens. The issuance, buyback and burning of ATRI tokens are managed by Atari Chain Ltd. in accordance with their policy that takes into account network growth, demand and usage.\n\nThe total supply of tokens
