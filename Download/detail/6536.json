{"data": {"id": 6536, "name": "MANTRA DAO", "symbol": "OM", "slug": "mantra-dao", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is MANTRA DAO (OM)?\n\nMANTRA DAO is a [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) platform with a specific focus on staking, lending and decentralized governance. The project is being built on the [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) RioChain and will be connected with [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/). It is intended to act as an ecosystem for Web 3.0.\n\nThe platform uses a native utility token, OM, for staking, lending and governance. While the project plans to move to the Polkadot network, the token has been initially issued on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain.\n\nMANTRA DAO was first [announced](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/introducing-mantra-dao-the-community-governed-defi-platform-dbdf4167ffdb) in June 2020, and the platform [went live](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/mantra-dao-staking-platform-goes-live-6800b753a82d) with its first feature, staking, in October 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of MANTRA DAO?\n\nMANTRA DAO was developed as a project of RioDeFi, the blockchain tech development company behind RioChain, where co-founders and long-time [friends](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/360244) John Patrick Mullin and Will Corkin [were](https://riodefiofficial.medium.com/rio-defi-welcomes-two-new-advisors-4d8ae602e424) advisors. The two launched the project as a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) alongside colleague Rodrigo Quan Miranda.\n\nMullin previously carried out fintech research at Chinese investment bank Guotai Junan Securities and has covered blockchain tech for both traditional and crypto media outlets. In September 2020, he was [appointed](https://polkastarter.medium.com/polkastarter-appoints-john-patrick-mullin-as-strategic-advisor-6a86493b51c9) a strategic advisor for [Polkastarter](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/polkastarter/), a Polkadot-based [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex). Corkin was previously vice president of business development for blockchain development company Trade.io, where he [worked](https://www.digfingroup.com/trade-io/) alongside Mullin. Corkin has also worked for FinTech Connector, a professional network for fintech startups and entrepreneurs. Along with Mullin, he is an ambassador for the Polkadot network.\n\nMiranda [founded](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/mantra-dao-contributor-spotlight-series-5bf35ebd4211) Moon Street Ventures, a blockchain research and development and consulting company, and co-founded and served as CEO of Immutable Technologies Corp, a decentralized network infrastructure provider. He was previously an investment banker.\n\nMullin, Corkin and Miranda, along with RioDeFi CEO James Anderson and chief marketing officer Stephane Laurent Villedieu, form the founding council of MANTRA DAO.\n\n\n#### What Makes MANTRA DAO Unique?\n\nAccording to MANTRA DAO, several [announced](https://twitter.com/MANTRADAO/status/1328660002303844353) features make the project unique. First, it is being built on RioChain and will be connected with Polkadot, which it [described](https://mantradao.com/blog/polkadefi-and-why-it-is-the-future-of-defi/) as a \"next-generation blockchain.\" Second, it offers multiasset staking, lending and borrowing for both its own platform and others such as [Cosmos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/) (ATOM) and [Terra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/) (LUNA). Third, it [operates](https://mantradao.medium.com/win-crypto-every-week-with-mantra-pool-140a14057c27) MANTRA POOL through which 25% of the foundation's staking rewards are given away. And finally, it uses a \"karma\" protocol that assigns scores to network participants based on their contributions, granting users with high scores increased benefits.\n\nThe MANTRA DAO ecosystem is powered by OM, which is used to govern the DAO and for staking and lending. OM token holders receive an estimated 88.8% annualized reward for staking on the platform. OM was issued as an [ERC-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20), but the platform plans to migrate to the Polkadot network.\n\nAs [outlined](https://mantradao.com/files/MANTRA_DAO_Whitepaper.pdf) in its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), the business plan of MANTRA DAO is focused on collecting interest on loans, staking OM, operating a staking-as-a-service business that charges fees on staked assets, and providing business-to-business access to its products. A number of investment firms [backed](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/mantra-dao-entices-institutional-and-retail-investors-from-all-corners-of-the-world-fbace8222e01) its \"initial membership offering,\" including Kenetic Capital, Genesis Block and Moonrock Capital.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Compound](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/), another major DeFi lending platform.\n\nLearn about [Maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/), the governance token of another decentralized autonomous organization, MakerDAO.\n\nCurious about yield farming? Read an [in-depth explanation](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on the latest developments in the DeFi sector with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many MANTRA DAO (OM) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nMANTRA DAO has a total token supply of 888,888,888 OM. Of this amount, 75.6 million OM (8.5%) was sold during a presale and \"initial membership offering\" that [kicked off](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/initial-membership-offering-update-286a9a6d858e) in July 2020. An additional 80 million (9%) was allocated for private distribution, with a six-month vesting period.\n\nThe remaining tokens were [distributed](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/om-token-circulating-supply-emission-schedule-update-september-22nd-2020-d355cb6ffafd) as follows:\n\n\n\n*   155.6 million OM (17.5%) for the team and advisors, with one-eighteenth coming into circulation every 30 days.\n*   266.7 million OM (30%) for staking rewards, the majority of which will be released in a nonlinear decaying growth function over approximately five years.\n*   111.1 million OM (12.5%) for funding referral programs, the majority of which will be released on a rolling basis in a linear pattern over approximately five years.\n*   88.9 million OM (10%) for reserves, much of which will be released on a rolling basis in a linear pattern over five years.\n*   111.1 million OM (12.5%) for grants to fund protocol development initiatives.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, users are required to send 1 OM to a MANTRA DAO-controlled wallet in order to enter into the MANTRA POOL, the total of which will be burned every quarter. However, in November 2020, the project [stated](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/month-in-review-and-q4-outlook-mantra-dao-ama-recap-ad0d2c814fe4) that it does not plan to burn any tokens.\n\n\n### How Is the MANTRA DAO Network Secured?\n\nMANTRA DAO's OM governance token is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that OM transactions are validated by the Ethereum network. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nThe project appointed custody provider Hex Trust as the custodian for its digital assets, and in December 2020, the project [announced](https://twitter.com/MANTRADAO/status/1337342709405786112) that the [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) for the next iteration of its OM token had been audited by blockchain security company SlowMist.\n\nMANTRA DAO will migrate to Polkadot via RioChain, which was [audited](https://riodefiofficial.medium.com/riochain-audit-report-76b7b39dbede) in September 2020 by blockchain cybersecurity firm CertiK, finding no major security flaws.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy MANTRA DAO (OM)?\n\nOM can be purchased on [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges such as Hotbit, OKEx, Bithumb Global and [Uniwap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), among others. It can be traded on spot markets against the New Taiwan dollar, cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), and the stablecoin [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT).\n\nAre you interested in buying OM or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin)? CoinMarketCap has a simple, [step-by-step guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to teach you all about crypto and how to buy your first coins.\n", "dateAdded":
