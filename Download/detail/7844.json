{"data": {"id": 7844, "name": "ACryptoS", "symbol": "ACS", "slug": "acryptos", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is ACryptoS (ACS)?\n\nACryptoS is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) product that runs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and utilizes complex crypto strategies. The two primary ACryptoS products are yield optimizers, also called the ACryptoS Vaults, and a stablecoin decentralized exchange, ACryptoS StableSwap.\n\nThe yield optimizers help users maximize profits through vaults that use advanced yield farming techniques. These techniques are automated to help farmers grow their assets in a more efficient and fast manner.\n\nACryptoS Vaults are investment tools that execute strategies via smart contracts. The vaults make use of assets deposited by the users to perform tasks such as providing liquidity and collateralization, generating yields and compounding interests. Although the vault runs on the BSC, it is a fork of the Ethereum-based yearn.finance ([YFI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)).\n\nACryptoS Vaults employ some features of the farming mechanism of [SushiSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/). Some of the most popular vaults offered by ACryptoS are ACS/ACSI and Venus token vaults. Users who provide ACS and ACSI to the vaults can earn higher yields through a programmed yield farming mechanism. \n\nACryptoS StableSwap is an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) that allows for fast stablecoin trading on the BSC. StableSwap allows for trading with less slippage and lower fees. \n\n\n#### What Makes ACryptoS Unique?\n\nACryptoS is built to encourage long-term staking. Stakers who hold the ACS and ACSI tokens for prolonged periods of time are rewarded. When users make deposits to the vault, they can earn compound interest in an automated manner. The vaults employ programmed strategies that help users grow their assets, save time, manage gas usage and perform other automated tasks.\n\nACryptoS StableSwap helps users find the best available prices to easily swap stablecoins at low fees and with minimal slippage. Liquidity providers are incentivized with ACS and ACSI tokens to deposit their funds in ACryptoS Farms. \n\nAnother unique feature of ACryptoS is that anyone can earn harvester rewards by harvesting an ACryptoS vault. This ensures that the automation of vaults remains decentralized. Visit [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/) to learn more about yield farming and AMMs.\n\n\n#### How Many ACryptoS (ACS) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nACS and ACSI tokens are native to the ACryptoS platform. ACS is a BEP-20 token. Its maximum supply is 1,888,888 tokens. After the initial emission, this supply is subject to an 18.65% decrease every 90 days. The ACS team can mint 3% of the total supply for the ACryptos Treasury.\n\nACS can be staked in the ACS Vaults to earn aggregated returns from the fees, ACS farms and rewards.  The ACS token in the ACS vault (acsACS) is the governance token and cannot be transferred. The minimum acsACS required to create new community proposals is 88, while users need 1 token to vote.\n\nBoth ACS and ACSI have similar tokenomics, but ACSI is used as an incentive on the StableSwap. The ACSI also has a maximum supply of 1,888,888 tokens.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [mining Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin).\n\nLearn more about [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake).\n\nLearn more about [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming).\n\n\n### How Is the ACryptoS Network Secured?\n\nThe platform does not utilize either proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) or proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus algorithms. The ACS and ACSI tokens are native to the ACryptoS platform. The network has been audited by DefiYield.info and Hacken. Based on the audit, the protocol was regarded as low-risk by DefiYield.info.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy ACryptoS (ACS)?\n\nACryptoS (ACS) can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*
