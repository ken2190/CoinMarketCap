Expect Chaos is a reasonable expectation.\r\n\r\nCrab mainly provides a simulation environment for Darwinia's upgrade and application deployment, performs various radical experiments. Crab includes not only the complete software operation environment and network environment but also the economic environment.\r\n\r\nCrab is the first cross-chain NFT blockchain in Polkadot ecology, providing smart contract solutions, compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine, and supporting Dapps such as Defi and NFT to easily migrate Polkadot.\r\n\r\nRelying on the innovative bridge technology of the Darwinia Network, it also provides an entrance to the Polkadot ecology for projects that have been deployed on public blockchains such as Ethereum and BSC.\r\n\r\nCrab also provides users with a very low transaction fee. The new continent of Darwinia ecosystem cross-chain game Evolution Land has been deployed on Crab, will soon launch the new NFT+Defi GameFi system.\r\n\r\nCrab is a long-term valuable network. Some RINGs are allocated to Crab Network as backing assets to make it serve as a canary network having real economic incentives and massive gaming theory testing, not just working a testnet.\r\n\r\nCrab has the same parameters as Darwinia Mainnet, and uses the same Staking mechanism and inflation model. Crab\u2019s tokens are CRING and CKTON, the initial supply of CRING is 200M, and the supply of CKTON is 0.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:33:03.000Z", "watchCount": "711", "dateLaunched": "2020-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "2036407896.3553572", "urls": {"website": ["https://crab.network", "https://darwinia.network/"], "technical_doc": ["https://darwinia.network/Darwinia_Genepaper_EN.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://crab.subscan.io/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/darwinia-network"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/@DarwiniaNetwork"], "chat": ["https://t.me/DarwiniaNetwork"], "announcement": ["https://twitter.com/DarwiniaNetwork"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/DarwiniaCommunity"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/@DarwiniaNetwork"]}, "volume": 10023.56290019, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -20.4837, "statistics": {"price": 0.00304658333004, "priceChangePercentage1h": -0.59948503, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.81340361, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.68147634, "priceChangePercentage30d": -3.81228392, "priceChangePercentage60d": -35.99763077, "priceChangePercentage90d": -66.64003192, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4123, "low24h": 0.00293502, "high24h": 0.00309847, "low7d": 0.00238821, "high7d": 0.00309847, "low30d": 0.00238821, "high30d": 0.00400109, "low90d": 0.00238821, "high90d": 0.01109623, "low52w": 0.00238821, "high52w": 0.01407819, "lowAllTime": 0.00238821, "highAllTime": 0.01407819, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 27.57, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -78.36, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-25T18:51:04.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-04-15T22:27:03.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00272018, "highYesterday": 0.00303464, "openYesterday": 0.0027286, "closeYesterday": 0.00297544, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 9.05, "volumeYesterday": 14102.18, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.39573307597338, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.99695168, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.65196276}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.13951826462414, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.41720606, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.23403521}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04642130446666, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47479612, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76378252}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34543127132665, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.10634214, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.07975349}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08809375205785, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47012283, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.20479819}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3365804189963, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.72571723, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.81210172}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.61551425760311, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.84200543, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.02118715}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12756201108951, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.48873139, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44700682}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04698230570444, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32158169, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.92562492}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:33:27.141Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "10", "credit_count": 0}}
