The decentralized exchange works with liquidity pools, which allow users to earn money by providing liquidity for a pair of assets. The liquidity providers receive a very small percentage of the transactions (0.1%).\r\n \r\nFor trusted pairs, such as projects that launch on KuSwap, the exchange will return the swap fees in the form of KUS tokens, effectively making the transaction fee-free for these selected pairs.\r\n\r\nYield farming on KuSwap lets users that are providing liquidity earn KUS rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract. The incentive is to balance out the risk of impermanent loss that comes along with locking in your liquidity.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes KuSwap Unique?\r\nKuSwap, in its full form, is an ecosystem on its own within the larger ecosystem of KCC (KuCoin Community Chain). \r\n\r\nIt consists of a Launchpad, a Lending Platform, a truly decentralized NFT Marketplace, and KuDrops - a built-in element of KuSwap that is designed to promote information campaigns, community development, and to maintain the community at its best at all times.\r\n\r\nThrough KUSDAO - KuSwap's governance platform where holders stake on proposals and contribute to making the KuSwap permissionless and decentralised, and hence efficient and secure for all users.\r\n\r\nThrough these platforms, a vast array of utilities can be found in the KuSwap token, thereby making it an invaluable asset to users of crypto and Decentralized Finance.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:54:37.000Z", "watchCount": "580", "dateLaunched": "2021-06-24T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.35, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://kuswap.finance"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://explorer.kcc.io/en/address/0x4a81704d8c16d9fb0d7f61b747d0b5a272badf14", "https://explorer.kcc.io/en/address/0x4a81704d8c16d9fb0d7f61b747d0b5a272badf14"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/KuSwap"], "message_board": ["https://kuswap.medium.com"], "chat": ["https://t.me/kuswapfinance"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/KuSwapFinance"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/kuswapfinance"]}, "volume": 2035614.76044974, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 169.882, "statistics": {"price": 5.24643780659776, "priceChangePercentage1h": 1.37933533, "priceChangePercentage24h": 83.37074599, "priceChangePercentage7d": 59.26823981, "priceChangePercentage30d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 1836253232.31, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 350000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 2719, "roi": 1398.98223046, "low24h": 2.83281838, "high24h": 5.26197204, "low7d": 2.33299525, "high7d": 5.26197204, "low30d": 2.33299525, "high30d": 5.26197204, "low90d": 2.33299525, "high90d": 5.26197204, "low52w": 2.33299525, "high52w": 5.26197204, "lowAllTime": 2.33299525, "highAllTime": 5.26197204, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 124.88, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -0.3, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-29T16:16:06.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-31T11:24:25.000Z", "lowYesterday": 2.62356057, "highYesterday": 3.85707628, "openYesterday": 2.63429355, "closeYesterday": 3.76993622, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 43.11, "volumeYesterday": 1429074.85, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 2087, "contractAddress": "0x4a81704d8c16d9fb0d7f61b747d0b5a272badf14", "contractPlatform": "KCC", "contractPlatformId": 43, "contractChainId": -1, "contractRpcUrl": [], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": -1, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "", "contractExplorerUrl": "", "platformCryptoId": 2087}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.15277603529009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97491332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.15383074}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.34964051346751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.48864478, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65721962}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04606059556592, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.60454635, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.52026324}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35073162374456, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.29500189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.00533147}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08805508567185, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49406181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.66853882}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33953608915345, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.35932698, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.52614735}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.81208358366918, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.33740637, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.63805644}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884983830176, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.8379087, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.06023177}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05089512675303, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.36180993, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01964127}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 1420, "name": "KuSwap", "slug": "kuswap"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:55:47.537Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
