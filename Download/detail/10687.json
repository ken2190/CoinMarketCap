{"data": {"id": 10687, "name": "Onomy Protocol", "symbol": "NOM", "slug": "onomy-protocol", "category": "token", "description": "Onomy firmly believes in three fundamental truths. First, the new paradigm of finance whereby centralized finance will migrate on-chain is not only inevitable, but imminent. Second, stablecoins are the vehicle that will onboard liquidity from traditional institutions with significantly less friction. Lastly, with many prominent and talented blockchain ecosystems, the future of decentralized finance is cross-chain. \r\n\r\nConsequently, Onomy Protocol aims to serve as the world\u2019s de-facto Decentralized Reserve Bank to accelerate the CeFi to DeFi migration by sustaining cross-chain financial product deployments that converge the $6.6T/day foreign currency exchange marketplace with decentralized finance and native crypto assets. \r\n\r\nThrough Onomy Protocol\u2019s infrastructure & financial products, users may easily mint, trade, and lend stable representations of national currencies within a highly interoperable and efficient environment, accessing significant yield opportunities through stablecoin lending and liquidity provision, unlike what\u2019s currently achievable within bank-governed interest mechanics. \r\nOnomy places immense care into building a frictionless onboarding experience for retail, enterprise and institutional users, removing entry barriers and to all user types, regardless of access to capital. \r\n\r\nThe Onomy Bridge Hub enables users to transfer native assets and Denoms (fiat-pegged stablecoins) via bridged blockchains. \r\n\r\nOnomy Protocol is a proof of stake chain built with the Cosmos SDK and integrates IBC. The protocol token NOM provides the underlying single collateral for multi stablecoin minting, offers yield opportunities, and grants governance rights over the DAO.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-28T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "32", "dateLaunched": "2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://onomy.io/"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.onomy.io/"], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://github.com/onomyprotocol"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/onomy-protocol/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/onomyprotocol", "https://discord.gg/27r73SYAkQ"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/onomyprotocol"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.99195551596571, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.37778497, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.76126544}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33076201801208, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.46531284, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.96789566}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04600186231469, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.14868791, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.17285939}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35225527622235, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.11423849, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.42822185}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08804213776288, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49769861, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.56837823}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3483481875156, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.45162233, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.05712907}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.82545567829481, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.69671449, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.87444725}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.1291243021993, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.62706083, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.22580141}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0504277483724, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.40139621, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.86305219}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:54:01.944Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
