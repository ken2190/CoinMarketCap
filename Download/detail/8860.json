Every transaction has a 10% fee, 5% is burned and 5% is redistributed to all holders.\n\n\n### WATER is the native token for WaterDeFi and is used for and will be used for:\n\n\n\n* Frictionless Farming by just holding the token, no staking required.\n* Minting $ICE token in the future for DAO and Startup Farming/Staking. (Future)\n* NFT Marketplace, Lottery, and more that will increase burn rate of $WATER. (Future)\n* WaterDeFi aims to provide a two-sided farming ecosystem, frictionless and non-frictionless. $WATER is the frictionless end of the ecosystem and allows a safe, risk-free automatic staking of a deflationary asset.\n\nWaterDeFi is not a pump and dump project but a project that seeks real usage in the future.\n\n### Is it safe to invest in WATER?\n\nYes, the team has tried to be as transparent as possible. The startup presale and launch is at the same price of $0.055 and the presale had a limit of 10BNB per wallet.\n\nAs of launch, 50% of the initial liquidity provided has been burned and the other 50% has been locked for 3 months (since launch) and will be relocked after it has been unlocked. This is to ensure that there are no rug-pulls and the investment is as safe as possible.\n\nThe team has tried to perform audits as soon as possible to gain the trust of the community.\n\n\n### How many WATER tokens are there in circulation?\n\nWATER token launched on Binance Smart Chain main-net on March 6, 2021, with 1 million WATER tokens minted for the single time. Every transaction has a 5% burn fee which constantly decreases the supply of the token, therefore, pushing the price upwards over time.\n\n\n### Where can I buy WATER?\n\nWATER is available for trading on PancakeSwap Decentralised Exchange using the WATER-BNB pair that has liquidity. PancakeSwap automatically routes to the best liquidity source so it doesn't really matter which token you swap for WATER.\n\n", "dateAdded": "2021-03-17T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice":
