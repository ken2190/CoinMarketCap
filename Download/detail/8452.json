Shield 2FA is not owned by any single node in the network. Peers in the network can be any single computer which is connected to the internet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed for SHIELD 2FA on blockchain::\r\n\r\nIn every centralised apps today we are facing with issues that are concerned with our data they have. There have been number of data breaches despite many secure setups companies are using, there is always a hole in centralised system that give way for hackers to enter and perform breaches. Even sometimes if business uses very safe and secure system then also breaches happen due to internal leakages. Data breaches are on rise and we can see number of Data on dark web being posted after hacks including username and password, only people using 2FA get away from their login been used by hackers but still end up leaking their personal email and password that they might have used in any other account with no 2FA. Shield 2FA is trying to eliminate the use of personal details for login and even eliminating centralised storage and replacing it with cross chain blockchain, so a system which will not take any personal detail or use any centralised storage but will still solve the purpose and will showcase the actual use case of blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n## SHIELD key Utilities?\r\n\r\n* Fees: Use your shield token to pay for blockchain usage fees. Securing your secrets will come with small fees that can be paid in Shield token and more add on features on Shield app can be paid using token. \r\n* Staking Rewards: Shield users can stake their tokens to earn rewards in shield token or in future partner tokens. \r\n* Bonus:- Shield token holders will be rewarded under different reward programs that will launch time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How many SHIELD Tokens are there in Circulation?\r\n\r\nSHIELD Protocol launched through IDO with 200,000 Public-Sale tokens supply on Bakeryswap DEX on February 10, 2021. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Who is the Founder of SHIELD Protocol?\r\n\r\nRahul Sharma is a Founder & CEO of SHIELD PROTOCOL. He is experienced security data scientist with a demonstrated history of working in the Data Research Industry from last 10 years.
