{"data": {"id": 2010, "name": "Cardano", "symbol": "ADA", "slug": "cardano", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano is a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow \u201cchangemakers, innovators and visionaries\u201d to bring about positive global change.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Cardano](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/cardano).\n\nThe open-source project also aims to \u201credistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals\u201d \u2014 helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair.\n\nCardano was founded back in 2017, and the ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software.\n\nThe team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity.\n\nCardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products built on the platform allow educational credentials to be stored in a tamper-proof way, and retailers to clamp down on counterfeit goods.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Cardano?\n\nCardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was also one of the co-founders of the Ethereum network. He is the CEO of IOHK, the company that built Cardano\u2019s blockchain.\n\nIn an interview for[ CoinMarketCap\u2019s Crypto Titans series](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/11/charles-hoskinson-on-the-power-of-crypto-working-from-home-and-mongolian-hunting-falcons-2/), Hoskinson said that he got involved in cryptocurrencies back in 2011 \u2014 and dabbled in mining and trading. He explained that his first professional involvement in the industry came in 2013, when he created a course about Bitcoin that ended up being taken by 80,000 students.\n\nAs well as being a technology entrepreneur, Hoskinson is also a mathematician. In 2020, his technology company donated ADA worth $500,000 to the University of Wyoming\u2019s Blockchain Research and Development Lab.\n\n### What Makes Cardano Unique?\n\nCardano is one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof-of-work algorithm relied upon by Bitcoin. Although the much larger Ethereum is going to be [upgrading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) to PoS, this transition is only going to take place gradually.\n\nThe project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research, meaning that bold ideas can be challenged before they are validated. According to the Cardano team, this academic rigor helps the blockchain to be durable and stable \u2014 increasing the chance that potential pitfalls can be anticipated in advance.\n\nIn 2020, Cardano held a Shelley upgrade that aimed to make its blockchain \u201c50 to 100 times more decentralized\u201d than other large blockchains. At the time, Hoskinson predicted that this would pave the way for hundreds of assets to run on its network.\n\n**Related Pages**:\n\n[Read our interview with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/11/charles-hoskinson-on-the-power-of-crypto-working-from-home-and-mongolian-hunting-falcons-2/)\n\n[A deep dive into the technology behind Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0)\n\n[Brush up on complicated crypto terms with our glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary)\n\n[Check out our other interviews with crypto heavyweights](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) \n\n[A Deep Dive Into Cardano](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-cardano)\n\n[Read our crypto staking guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/crypto-staking-guide-2021)\n\n### How Many Cardano (ADA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere is a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA \u2014 but at the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of about 31 billion. Five rounds of public sales of Cardano tokens were held between September 2015 and January 2017.\n\nApproximately 2.5 billion ADA was allotted to IOHK once the network launched. Meanwhile, an additional 2.1 billion ADA was given to Emurgo, a global blockchain technology company that served as a founding entity of the Cardano protocol. Last but not least, 648 million ADA was given to the not-for-profit Cardano Foundation, which aims to promote the platform and increase levels of adoption.\n\nOverall, about 16% of ADA\u2019s total supply went to the project\u2019s founders, with the remaining 84% being split among investors.\n\n### How Is the Cardano Network Secured?\n\nCardano is secured through an \u201cenvironmentally sustainable, verifiably secure\u201d PoS protocol that\u2019s known as Ouroboros.\n\nThe project says that Ouroboros improves upon the security guarantees that are delivered by a PoW consensus mechanism while using substantially less power \u2014 claiming that it is four times more energy efficient than Bitcoin.\n\nIt is described as a blend of unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms, with behavioral psychology and economic philosophy thrown in for good measure. Overall, the objective of Ouroboros is to achieve sustainable and ethical growth.\n\nAn incentive mechanism means that participants in the network are rewarded for their involvement.\n\n### Where Can You Buy Cardano (ADA)?\n\nAs one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market capitalization, you shouldn\u2019t have much difficulty in finding a major exchange to [buy Cardano](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Cardano) on including Binance, Bittrex, eToro, and HitBTC.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find a trading pair that unites ADA with your local currency, check
