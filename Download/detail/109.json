{"data": {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "symbol": "DGB", "slug": "digibyte", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is DigiByte (DGB)?\n\nDigiByte (DGB) is an open source [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) and asset creation platform. Development began in October 2013 and the [genesis block](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/genesis-block) of its DGB token was mined in January 2014 as a fork of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC).\n\nA longstanding public blockchain and cryptocurrency, DigiByte uses five different algorithms to improve security, and originally aimed to improve on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s security, capacity and transaction speed.\n\nDigiByte consists of three layers: a smart contract \u201cApp Store,\u201d a public ledger and the core protocol featuring nodes communicating to relay transactions.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of DigiByte?\n\nDigiByte was created by Jared Tate, also known as \u201cDigiMan,\u201d who oversaw its metamorphosis from development to its current setup before announcing that he was temporarily retiring from his position in May 2020.\n\nTate has since returned, and as of September 2020 once again appears closely involved with DigiByte\u2019s growth.\n\nTate\u2019s biography states that he was involved with Bitcoin from 2012 onwards, and authored the first book written by a blockchain founder, \u201cBlockchain 2035: The Digital DNA of Internet 3.0.\u201d\n\nDigiByte\u2019s operations depend not only on developers, but also the DigiByte Foundation, a volunteer organization tasked with overseeing preservation of the project. A third group of volunteers, the DigiByte Awareness Team, is responsible for marketing and promotional activities.\n\n\n#### What Makes DigiByte Unique?\n\nDigiByte is a modification of Bitcoin which aims to diversify security, speed and capacity possibilities.\n\nIts first incarnation was as an open source blockchain and associated cryptocurrency, DGB. The network has five separate algorithms which help to maintain security and help prevent [ASIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/asic) miners from commandeering too much power.\n\nLater, another offering, DigiAssets, appeared, with DGB as its native token. DigiAssets appeals to those developers looking to launch digital assets, decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) and encode the necessary corresponding smart contracts.\n\nAll governance structures for DigiByte are run on a voluntary basis, in line with the thesis that the network should be open source and publicly accessible. Transaction fees in DGB are paid to [miners](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin) for validating the blockchain.\n\n\n##### **Related Pages**:\n\nFind out more about Litecoin (LTC) [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin).\n\nFind out more about Ethereum (ETH) [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum).\n\nNew to cryptocurrency? Find out everything you need to know with [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics), CoinMarketCap\u2019s dedicated education resource.\n\n\n##### How Many DigiByte (DGB) Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\nDigiByte (DGB) is a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) cryptocurrency, and miners earn tokens for validating blocks via block rewards.\n\nIn January 2014, 0.5% of the total DGB supply (105 million coins) was premined. 50% of the premine was reserved for development purposes, while the remainder was given away. \n\nDGB has a hard supply cap of 21 billion tokens, with mining forming an emission curve with decreasing issuance \u2014 the block reward reduces by 1% each month.\n\nDigiByte has stated that it purposely did not try to raise funds or give away tokens through instruments such as an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) or similar token sale.\n\n\n#### How Is the DigiByte Network Secured?\n\nDigiByte uses a total of five proof-of-work algorithms to secure the blockchain and reduce the risk of double spending or [51% attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack). \n\nDifficulty adjustments ensure resilience against hostile moves within mining circles, with DigiByte claiming to have the most advanced such difficulty setup among cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith roughly one block every 15 seconds, DigiByte\u2019s blockchain has managed to prove the longevity of its PoW blockchain since launch, now having a much longer chain of PoW than, for example, Bitcoin.\n\n\n#### Where Can You Buy DigiByte (DGB)?\n\nDGB is a freely-tradable altcoin and is available on multiple exchanges. Trading pairs are available for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies. \n\nBilaxy, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), Sistemkoin and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) had the lion\u2019s share of volume for DGB trading pairs as of September 2020.\n\nNew to crypto?
