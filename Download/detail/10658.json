One that embraces the gaming/streaming industry and thrives off of being a community-orientated cryptocurrency. By implementing blockchain technology, they have set out to become a revolutionising gaming token with various use cases.\n\nGaming does not discriminate, and so, the founders at PogCoin felt the need to create a community where both types of gamers feel welcome. PogCoin is designed to bridge together revolutionising technology with gaming, and establish a single platform that hosts a variety of products, such as; a NFT marketplace, tournament organiser app, streaming platform, PogCoin Virtual Arcade, etc.\n\nPogCoin hosts daily/weekly community gaming sessions and tournaments, of which players can win retro gaming systems and token/NFT airdrops. The games that they play, include both retro and modern games, such as; Mario Kart, Warzone, Minecraft, FIFA and much more!\n\n\nPOG is a token that is used for:\n\n* NFT marketplace currency.\n* Payment method for the upcoming tournament organisation app.\n* Prize incentive for tournaments and eSports competitions.\n* With more utilising features being added constantly.\n\n\nPOG Tokenomics Include:\n\n* POG has a total tax of 10%. \n    * 4% Auto-redistribution of POG tokens to holders.\n    * 4% Auto-liquidity, added to the liquidity pool to further strengthen it.\n* Auto-redistribution is a hard-coded staking method, which is an incentive for long-term holders.\n* Auto-liquidity allows for a constant source of liquidity to be provided, supporting trades without the need to manually provide liquidity.\n* Allocated wallets for marketing have been set prior to our launch to ensure that they have enough capital to apply for exchanges, promote their brand and grow PogCoin further. \n* 50% of the POG supply has also been burned, and will continue to be burned as the milestones/goals on the PogCoin roadmap is completed.\n\nHow Many POG Coins Are There in Circulation? \n\u2028PogCoin launched on the Binance Smart Chain on May 12, 2021 with 100 billion POG tokens initially created. The Initial presale was then followed on May 18, 2021. 50 billion POG tokens (50%) was burned shortly after the contract deployment and there are currently 47 billion POG in circulation. \n\n\u2028Who Are the Founders of PogCoin? \n\u2028The original idea for PogCoin was created by Idiris Yunis, who became intrigued within blockchain technology and paired his curiosity with his passion for gaming. \n\u2028He then set up a founding team, with co-founders such as; Mohamed Omar (Marketing) and Ilyas Yunis (Community Manager). With backing from reputable crypto-orientated community owners and experienced advisors, they were able to rapidly build their community. \n\u2028Shortly after a month of launching, they are now setting up their first PogCoin headquarters. Starting off with 3-4 core members, they plan to grow more in the future and expand our reach.\n\n\nWhere Can I Buy POG?\n\nPOG is available for buying and trading on a growing number of centralised and decentralised exchanges. PogCoin is currently using the PancakeSwap exchange as their main trading platform, whilst they transition to larger exchanges.\n\nAs of now due to their automated tax function, most exchanges do not support this feature and will need to integrate it within their platforms. Therefore, they will continue to prioritise trading on the PancakeSwap exchange.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime":
