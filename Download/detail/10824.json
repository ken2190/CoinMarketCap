{"data": {"id": 10824, "name": "Hertz Network", "symbol": "HTZ", "slug": "hertz-network", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Hertz Network (HTZ)?\n\nLaunched in February 2021, Hertz Network is a fast, feeless and DeFi blockchain protocol allowing users to create custom tokens almost instantly and exchange them on the Hertz Network Defi Platform (available Q3 2021). The network incorporates various features that make it suitable for real-world usage, and for users both inside and outside the crypto world. \n\nHertz Coin (HTZ) is the native currency of the Hertz Network blockchain, and is swappable with HTZ BEP-20 or HTZ ERC-20 at supporting exchanges. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Hertz Network?\n\nHertz Network is a community project and team members are volunteers from the community. The Hertz Network team currently comprises 12 people with different professional backgrounds from various parts of the world.\n\n\n## What Makes Hertz Network Unique?\n\nThe Hertz Network runs on its own blockchain and incorporates various features that make it unique from most crypto projects in the market.\n\nThe 6 key strengths that differentiate Hertz Network from other projects are:\n\n#### 1) FAST\n\nHertz Network has a block time of 0.5 second, and takes around 50 seconds to confirm a transaction (become irreversible). The network is among the fastest blockchain networks in the market.\n\n#### 2) FEELESS\n\nUsers can easily send and receive feeless transactions on the Hertz Network with user-friendly HTZ desktop, mobile or web wallet. \n\n#### 3) DEFI\n\nThe Hertz Network DeFi Platform, to be launched in Q3 2021, will allow users to swap HTZ with HNC-20 tokens (tokens built on Hertz Network). Any HNC-20 token can be added to the Hertz Network DeFi Platform.\n\n#### 4) TOKEN CREATION\n\nUsers can create cryptocurrency/token (HNC-20) on Hertz Network blockchain by using token creation tool at hertz-network.com. It will take seconds to create an HNC-20 token.\n\nHNC-20 is the official token protocol for the Hertz Network. HNC stands for Hertz Network Chain, and 20 is the unique identifier - a common standard for creating tokens on the Hertz Network blockchain. \n\nHNC20 tokens are stored and sent using Hertz Network blockchain addresses and transactions. As with Hertz Coin (HTZ), HNC-20 token transactions are feeless.\n\nIn order to create an HNC-20 token to be supported by Hertz Network digital wallets, 3 items below are required.\n\n 1.    Token Name\n 2.    Token Symbol\n 3.    Token Supply\n\n#### 5) AUTOSTAKING\n\nHTZ AUTOSTAKING is a hassle-free reward system for HTZ holders. It differs from regular staking in that the rewards are paid quarterly and are not dependent on having an open wallet with the staking function enabled. \n\nAround 80% of HTZ supply are AUTOSTAKE rewards to be distributed to eligible wallet accounts once a quarter for 8 quarters from Q3 2021 to Q2 2023. Users can calculate future AUTOSTAKE rewards using the AUTOSTAKE rewards calculator at hertz-network.com.\nSimply hold 500,000 HTZ or more in an eligible wallet account at the time of the quarterly snapshot, and AUTOSTAKE rewards will be automatically sent to the wallet account. \n\n#### 6) CROSS-CHAIN SWAP\n\nHTZ is one of a few cryptocurrencies besides USDT that can be swapped between different chains at supporting exchanges. \n\nUsers can choose the desirable chain type (HTZ, HTZ ERC-20, or HTZ BEP-20) that suits their trading preference or wallet usage during the deposit or withdrawal at supporting exchanges including xt.com, dex-trade.com, and catex.io. \n\nHTZ BEP-20 contract address: 0xb5BBA78B4dF2D47DD46078514a3e296AB3c344Fe\nHTZ ERC-20 contract address: 0x0f7e1e6c9b67972a0ab31f47ab3e94b60be37d86\n\n### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about Hertz Network [here](https://hertz-network.com/about)\nLearn more about Hertz Autostaking [here](https://hertz-network.com/autostaking)\nLearn more about HNC-20 Token [here](https://hertz-network.com/hnc20-tokens)\nLearn more about Hertz Ecosystem [here](https://hertz-network.com/about/#ecosystem)\nLearn more about Hertz Video Turorials [here](https://hertz-network.com/academy)\nLearn more about Hertz Road Map [here](https://hertz-network.com/roadmap)\n\n\n## How Many Hertz Network (HTZ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe current circulating supply of HTZ is around 5.24 billion. The autostake rewards totaling 23.16 billion will be distributed to HTZ holders in 8 quarters from Q3 2021 to Q2 2023. The current total supply including autostake rewards and development fund is around 29.05 billion.\n\nOf the total supply, 17% belong to individual investors, 3% is kept in the development fund, and 80% are reserved for autostake rewards.\n\nWhen HTZ ERC-20 token or HTZ BEP-20 token is released to the circulation for the cross-chain swap, an equal amount of native HTZ coin is sent to a locked wallet \u201crecyclehertz\u201d to ensure that the total circulating supply of HTZ in all chains remains the same.\n\n\n## How Is Hertz Network Secured?\n\nThe Hertz Network mainnet is developed based on EOSIO software, and is secured through Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) consensus.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Hertz Network (HTZ)?\n\nBuying HTZ is easy because it has BEP-20 and ERC-20 alternatives. HTZ is currently listed on 7 exchanges including:\n\nXT.com:  HTZ, HTZ BEP-20, and HTZ ERC-20\nCatex.io: HTZ, HTZ BEP-20, and HTZ ERC-20\nDex-trade.com: HTZ, HTZ BEP-20, and HTZ ERC-20\nIndoex.io: HTZ\nFinexbox.com: HTZ\nPancakeswap: HTZ BEP-20\nUniswap: HTZ ERC-20\n\n*Users can easily swap between HTZ, HTZ BEP-20, and HTZ ERC-20 at Xt.com, Catex.io, and Dex-trade.com\n", "dateAdded": "2021-07-10T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:53:32.000Z", "watchCount": "391", "dateLaunched": "2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "29037301330.534", "urls": {"website": ["https://www.hertz-network.com"], "technical_doc": ["https://hertz-network.com/lightpaper"], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://github.com/hertznetwork/hertznetwork"], "message_board": ["https://hertznetwork.medium.com"], "chat": ["https://t.me/hertznetwork"], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5336221.0"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/hertznetwork"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/hertz_network"]}, "volume": 148243.34286575, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 14.2022, "statistics": {"price": 0.00029916869731, "priceChangePercentage1h": -0.03679145, "priceChangePercentage24h": -0.37300797, "priceChangePercentage7d": -30.61263049, "priceChangePercentage30d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 1567168.49, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": -0.373, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 8975060.92, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 5238410649.0, "totalSupply": 29037301330.534, "maxSupply": 30000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0001, "rank": 1473, "low24h": 0.00029665, "high24h": 0.00030113, "low7d": 0.00022699, "high7d": 0.00047063, "low30d": 0.00022699, "high30d": 0.00083054, "low90d": 0.00022699, "high90d": 0.00083054, "low52w": 0.00022699, "high52w": 0.00083054, "lowAllTime": 0.00022699, "highAllTime": 0.00083054, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 31.8, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -63.98, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-28T00:45:06.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-18T03:18:09.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00029665, "highYesterday": 0.00030122, "openYesterday": 0.00030039, "closeYesterday": 0.00029878, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -0.54, "volumeYesterday": 142383.61, "turnover": 0.09459311, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.12397158004247, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97590292, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.19688347}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33596831027774, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.77734443, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.79969763}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04605728182659, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.76071574, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.45447194}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35280381875814, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.16080009, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.18888228}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08800314377561, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.64715236, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.51409252}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34857459897508, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.72113979, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.05438462}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.82595372878242, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.87423756, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.88312147}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884161896118, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.72652786, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.98011293}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0504277483724, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.40139621, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.86305219}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 587, "name": "IndoEx", "slug": "indoex"}, {"id": 525, "name": "XT.COM", "slug": "xt"}, {"id": 514, "name": "Finexbox", "slug": "finexbox"}, {"id": 480, "name": "Cat.Ex", "slug": "catex"}, {"id": 154, "name": "Dex-Trade", "slug": "dex-trade"}], "isAudited": false, "distributions": [{"holder": "Development Fund", "percentage": 3.0}, {"holder": "Community", "percentage": 17.0}, {"holder": "Quarterly Autostake Rewards", "percentage": 80.0}], "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:55:11.687Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "13", "credit_count": 0}}
