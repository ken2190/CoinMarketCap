{"data": {"id": 8164, "name": "JulSwap", "symbol": "JULD", "slug": "julswap", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is JulSwap (JULD)?\n\nJulSwap, launched on December 29, 2020, is the equivalent of Uniswap ([UNI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/)) built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). JulSwap offers the same trading engine and analytics as Uniswap and some additional features from SushiSwap ([SUSHI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/)).\n\nJulSwap offers automated, decentralized exchange of BSC-20 tokens. The goal of this project is to lower the barrier to entry in decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)). The platform allows any user to create their own liquidity pool.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of JulSwap?\n\nJustLiquidity, which is the company behind JulSwap, was founded by Tobias Graf. Graf was also the founder and CEO of QuuTech, as well as the CEO of TGG Holding GmbH.\n\n\n#### What Makes JulSwap Unique?\n\nJulSwap has low trading fees due to the fact that it was built on the BSC. It allows users to retain full custody of their funds. \n\nWhereas on UniSwap, 0.3% of all trading fees in any pool are proportionately distributed to that pool\u2019s liquidity providers, in JulSwap, 0.25% go directly to the active liquidity providers, and the remaining 0.05% get converted back into JULb through JulSwap and distributed to the JFT Stakers.\n\nAny BEP-20 project can get listed on JulSwap for free. If a project owner or supporter wants to highlight a project on the Select Token Bar, they can bid at the end of the month in an auction for a spot on the top 10 rankings. These rewards are distributed among all JULb Holders who have more than 25 tokens in their wallets.\n\nJulSwap offers access to quick swaps, a beta decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)), staking, tokens, pairs, accounts, volume rankings, LaunchPad, governance and forums. It offers features such as an order book, limit orders, price alerts and trading view.\n\nJustLiquidity also launched JUL Wallet, which offers cross-chain support for various protocols including Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)), Matic, Avalanche, Huobi Eco Chain, Tomo Chain and Rinkeby.\n\nUsers can farm JULb tokens through the use of the JustLiquidity farming pool. They can withdraw their earned interest and the deposit 24 hours after the last transaction with the smart contract.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Dash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dash/).\n\nLearn more about [FRED Energy](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fred-energy/).\n\nLearn how to invest in cryptocurrency on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency).\n\nLearn more about cryptocurrencies on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many JulSwap (JULD) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nJulSwap (JULD) has a circulating supply of 190,607,625 JULD and a maximum supply of 800,000,000 JULD as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the JulSwap Network Secured?\n\nJulSwap uses the already audited Uniswap code which was modified for the JulSwap DEX. These modifications provide extra advantages such as staking and the auction feature.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy JulSwap (JULD)?\n\nIf you want to trade JulSwap (JULD), you can do so on the following
