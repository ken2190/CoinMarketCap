{"data": {"id": 10234, "name": "Draken", "symbol": "DRK", "slug": "draken", "category": "coin", "description": "DRK consensus is upgraded from Proof-of-Stake of ETH 2.0 into Proof-of-Honor (PoH), following the footsteps of other multi-billion-dollar projects such as TON by Telegram and Quorum by JP Morgan. The rationale behind our choice of ETH 2.0 (over EOS, TRON, Stellar, NEO, etc.) is because ETH 2.0 is optimized for utilities and supported by the largest and strongest communities of developers around the world. We further upgraded the PoS consensus of ETH 2.0 into Proof-of-Honor (PoH), which uses HodgeRank to rank nodes based on the amount of Stakes and amount of Transactions to encourage DApp developers to serve as many users and generate as many transactions as possible. In a comparison, it is much more advanced than Proof-of-Importance (PoI) of NEM, which uses NCDawareRank.\r\n\r\nPoH also adopts an advanced incentive system to eliminate all cheating & slacking miners to preserve the longevity of the blockchain network, and adopts a smart free-gas policy called \u201cGasStation\u201d which is more advanced than Tron\u2019s to make blockchain transactions cheaper while evenly anti-spam and incentivizing to miners.\r\n\r\nA privacy protocol on DRK called DaRK was invented as the first in the world to have scripting tools to support smart contracts and provide \u201cprivacy on demand\u201d (instead of \u201cprivacy by default\u201d), bringing blockchain closer to mass adoption. It combines the best of Aztec protocol, CryptoNote, BulletProof, and more. DaRK is a powerful weapon for our Smart Contract 2.0, making it more advanced than Mimblewimble and Zk-snark (which only accommodate native privacy coins without any scripting tools to write smart contracts).", "dateAdded": "2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:48:50.000Z", "watchCount": "4584", "dateLaunched": "2020-04-19T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "selfReportedTags": ["DeFi", "Bulletproofs", "Privacy", "Zero Knowledge Proofs", "Smart Contracts", "DApp", "ETH 2.0 Staking", "IoT"], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "893261759", "urls": {"website": ["https://draken.exchange/"], "technical_doc": ["https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mHtV50CktdFCyD_NaH370sZ8sOBehgce/view"], "explorer": ["https://explorer.draken.tech/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/drakentech"], "message_board": ["https://drkdefi.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/drkswapchat", "https://t.me/Drakentech"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/DRKDefi"]}, "volume": 350529.6674739, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 58.0391, "statistics": {"price": 0.03841150702156, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.78872905, "priceChangePercentage24h": -5.14514882, "priceChangePercentage7d": 8.27938884, "priceChangePercentage30d": 209.62332534, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 172045139.95, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 4479000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 3049, "low24h": 0.03753699, "high24h": 0.04049938, "low7d": 0.03716439, "high7d": 0.04168654, "low30d": 0.01000038, "high30d": 0.0444469, "low90d": 0.01000038, "high90d": 0.0444469, "low52w": 0.01000038, "high52w": 0.0444469, "lowAllTime": 0.01000038, "highAllTime": 0.0444469, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 284.1, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -13.58, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-09T07:24:13.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-20T00:46:10.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.03829176, "highYesterday": 0.04118158, "openYesterday": 0.04103148, "closeYesterday": 0.04007738, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -2.33, "volumeYesterday": 204148.71, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.91186752921941, "priceChangePercentage24h": 34.79177057, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.71962698}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.36960577973018, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.29293143, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.80735424}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0459154546492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.8379693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.59631629}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36217183431754, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.38713656, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.0655546}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08825297302251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.52298553, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.10265883}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34948277408693, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.0744453, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.19608689}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.84617771491492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.4837804, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.38743017}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884223796591, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.22962228, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.74739738}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05344197854214, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32002778, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.49536142}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 415, "name": "Bilaxy", "slug": "bilaxy"}, {"id": 400, "name": "Hotbit", "slug": "hotbit"}, {"id": 514, "name": "Finexbox", "slug": "finexbox"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:50:44.669Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
