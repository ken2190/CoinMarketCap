{"data": {"id": 10383, "name": "Cold Koala", "symbol": "COLDKOALA", "slug": "cold-koala", "category": "token", "description": "ColdKoala was started as a small project token on the BSC Network and the moment it was launched, it become an immediate hit with the Koala Community, even though the creator conducted a stealth launch, with no advertising what-so-ever.\n\nLaunched on May 20th, at roughly 11:30 EST AM, ColdKoala Coin strives to make a difference in the world by dedicating a large portion of its funds to supporting charities that work with endangered and injured koalas, such as those that were displaced during the Australian Wildfires.\nA charity wallet has been established with 10% of the token's minted supply and through the tokenomics that have been coded into the contract, that wallet will continue to grow with every transaction. It's those increases that will be sold off over time in order to fund the charities that have been selected.\n\nWhile the token has a large minted supply, with a total of 100 Sextillion tokens being minted at the launch of the project, 40% of those (40 Sextillion) were immediately burned at the beginning as a deflationary start. Furthermore, every transaction with ColdKoala incurs a 10% tax, of which 4% of that transaction is sent to the burn wallet, further increasing the deflationary nature of the token.\n\nCombined with the 4% burn tax, the other 6% is set as a yield-generating mechanism for the holders of ColdKoala. This means that every on every transaction, 6% of that transaction is then split amongst all the holders of CodlKoala, further encouraging people to not engage in day-trading mechanics, but rather, long-term investing. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t taken long for ColdKoala to establish itself a strong following. Within 48 hours of launch, the token had increased its holders to 1500, with a telegram community that numbered the same and as now affectionately been dubbed \u2018The Koala Family\u2019.  With such a strong following and the backing of the community, the Admin Team of ColdKoala is only driven even further to make this project a success, both for it\u2019s investors and for the charitable impacts that it can have throughout the world.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-09T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:51:04.000Z", "watchCount": "3696", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-19T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["http://www.coldkoala.com/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x1bfe24e7fb1d3b2dffd9c1d49372b07bc6fda829"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["http://t.me/ColdKoala", "https://discord.gg/J7spdHkP8b"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/ColdKoalaCoin"]}, "volume": 2854.50591995, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "statistics": {"price": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage7d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage30d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4457, "low24h": 0.0, "high24h": 0.0, "low7d": 0.0, "high7d": 0.0, "low30d": 0.0, "high30d": 0.0, "low90d": 0.0, "high90d": 0.0, "low52w": 0.0, "high52w": 0.0, "lowAllTime": 0.0, "highAllTime": 0.0, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 0, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": 0, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-09T21:40:04.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-13T03:42:03.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.0, "highYesterday": 0, "openYesterday": 0.0, "closeYesterday": 0.0, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0, "volumeYesterday": 0, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x1bfe24e7fb1d3b2dffd9c1d49372b07bc6fda829", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x1bfe24e7fb1d3b2dffd9c1d49372b07bc6fda829", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.93913845067335, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10541915, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.63438799}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33773955512395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.23981776, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.41715042}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04592046794645, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.23029735, "priceChangePercentage7d": 17.9758293}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08803051270921, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32754572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.77415107}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.86320486217138, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.14307618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6744906}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884102685655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.39973257, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44788409}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:51:47.357Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
