With developments in blockchain analysis, it became clear that transactions can actually be traced back to the senders, posing a great threat to users' privacy. \n\nTo solve this issue, BEAM came up with innovative ways of increasing the anonymity of transactions, address balances and user identities.\n\nBeam runs on the Mimblewimble protocol and was launched in March 2018.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of BEAM? \n\nSome of the leading team members of Beam include Alexander Zaidelson, Alex Romanov and Amir Aaronson.\n\nAlexander Zaidelson is the project\u2019s CEO. He started his career as a software developer and is an advisor to several startup projects. He has also founded a P2P file-sharing company Nareos. \n\nAlex Romanov, the CTO, has worked with large teams on several complex projects. \n\nBesides working on Beam, Amir Aaronson, the COO, has co-founded several technological companies.\n\n\n#### What Makes Beam Unique? \n\nBeam allows financial counterparties to make safe, stable and reliable transactions. This helps eliminate the problem of user data mismanagement, keeping the system cleaner and more secure. Beam\u2019s blockchain was built on the C++ programming language from scratch. \n\nUser addresses are kept confidential at all times and are never disclosed to any third parties. Users have total access and control over their privacy, deciding who can access their information and what they are allowed to see. \n\nBeam supports custom transactions of different types, such as [escrow](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary#escrow), atomic swaps and time-locked ones.\n\n\n#### How Many Beam (BEAM) Coins Are There in Circulation? \n\nBeam has a maximum supply of 262,800,000 tokens, of which 81,970,000 are in circulation as of February 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Beam Network Secured? \n\nBeam uses the Equihash proof-of-work algorithm which was chosen for its capacity to handle large amounts of data. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy BEAM? \n\nBEAM can be traded on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including:\n\n\n\n*
