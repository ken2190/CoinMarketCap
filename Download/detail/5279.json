{"data": {"id": 5279, "name": "Sologenic", "symbol": "SOLO", "slug": "sologenic", "category": "token", "description": "### What is Sologenic?\r\n\r\nSologenic is merging traditional finance with blockchain. The Sologenic ecosystem aims to make it effortless for crypto investors to exchange assets and invest in different conventional financial instruments. \r\n\r\nThe ecosystem aims to eliminate entry barriers for individual and institutional crypto investors. Sologenic allows them to trade non-blockchain asset classes, such as stocks, ETFs, and commodities, with one cryptocurrency SOLO. \r\n\r\n### Tokenize Assets with SOLO\r\n\r\nSOLO holders have access to a wide range of stocks from more than 30 global exchanges in North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. SOLO will enable people worldwide to buy and sell stock in their favorite companies without the need for traditional brokerages. \r\n\r\nSologenic generates stablecoins backed 1:1 with real-world assets. Each stablecoin represents the ownership of real-world assets. Once tokenized, the asset issued on the blockchain is denominated with the suffix \u01a7, for example, a tokenized asset of TSLA is represented as TSLA\u01a8.  \r\n\r\n### Trade Assets 24/7 on Sologenic's Decentralized Exchange\r\n\r\nUsers can trade these tokenized assets against SOLO or XRP on Sologenic\u2019s Decentralized Exchange (DEX). The users hold their private keys of the wallets, providing them complete ownership and authority over their crypto assets. The XRP Ledger allows for swift transactions, quick settlements, and improved security of the user's cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\n100% of the transaction fees are burned by being sent to the gateway\u2019s issuing address (Blackhole). This means that Sologenic practices a deflationary mechanism to bring down the total supply of SOLO tokens.\r\n\r\n### Solo Cards\r\n\r\nSOLO holders are eligible to obtain a free SOLO Card to spend their cryptos or tokenized assets anywhere in the world. SOLO holders have various benefits with the SOLO Cards, such as monthly cashback, airport lounge access, discounts on select hotels and private events. \r\n\r\n### Solo Staking\r\n\r\nSOLO holders can voluntarily participate in the Liquidity Provider Reward Program (LPRP), and receive rewards of up to 20% annually. There are multiple time-based programs, with both weekly or monthly participation models. Some of these programs come with flexible withdrawal terms, whereas others come with a fixed time-based deposit model. There is a daily reward payout mechanism for flexible programs and a time-based payout for fixed-term reward programs.", "dateAdded": "2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:05:08.000Z", "watchCount": "4869", "dateLaunched": "2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.263738, "tags": [], "selfReportedTags": ["DeFi"], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "286998016", "urls": {"website": ["https://www.sologenic.com/"], "technical_doc": ["https://www.sologenic.com/downloads/sologenic-whitepaper.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://bithomp.com/explorer/rsoLo2S1kiGeCcn6hCUXVrCpGMWLrRrLZz"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/sologenic"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/SOLOGENICxGoSOLO"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/Sologenic"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/realSologenic"]}, "volume": 710104.71860192, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 12.3665, "statistics": {"price": 0.94303754781801, "priceChangePercentage1h": -0.59037243, "priceChangePercentage24h": -0.64400285, "priceChangePercentage7d": 1.23178379, "priceChangePercentage30d": -9.13166107, "priceChangePercentage60d": -29.28931194, "priceChangePercentage90d": -44.17360785, "marketCap": 188609214.58, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": -0.644, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 377215019.13, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": -0.75, "circulatingSupply": 200001808.0, "totalSupply": 399996279.1686, "maxSupply": 400000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0116, "rank": 242, "roi": 257.49978791, "low24h": 0.91928445, "high24h": 0.99197547, "low7d": 0.83694639, "high7d": 1.1102096, "low30d": 0.82033555, "high30d": 1.1102096, "low90d": 0.82033555, "high90d": 1.73298048, "low52w": 0.21037004, "high52w": 1.98067605, "lowAllTime": 0.13045838, "highAllTime": 1.98067605, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 622.86, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -52.39, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2020-03-18T07:06:14.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-04-18T13:54:03.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.9147513, "highYesterday": 0.98501879, "openYesterday": 0.94141911, "closeYesterday": 0.94897614, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0.8, "volumeYesterday": 621024.19, "turnover": 0.00376495, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 26.7566}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1042, "name": "Siacoin", "slug": "siacoin", "price": 0.01417544276826, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.09790246, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.4295714}, {"id": 52, "name": "XRP", "slug": "xrp", "price": 0.74788573128656, "priceChangePercentage24h": 3.92993192, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.64799262}, {"id": 1934, "name": "Loopring", "slug": "loopring", "price": 0.25696725519262, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.88622365, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.70312153}, {"id": 2320, "name": "Utrust", "slug": "utrust", "price": 0.23595717560323, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.06474525, "priceChangePercentage7d": 27.24899962}, {"id": 1984, "name": "Substratum", "slug": "substratum", "price": 0.00294148233731, "priceChangePercentage24h": -4.7307222, "priceChangePercentage7d": -4.77475252}, {"id": 4189, "name": "Ultra", "slug": "ultra", "price": 0.57660629276372, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.30146733, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.98163062}, {"id": 8066, "name": "YIELD App", "slug": "yield-app", "price": 0.37557454517385, "priceChangePercentage24h": -0.07344895, "priceChangePercentage7d": -7.23698792}, {"id": 5336, "name": "Homeros", "slug": "homeros", "price": 0.04682047481378, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.25033686, "priceChangePercentage7d": -0.54799231}, {"id": 7105, "name": "Permission Coin", "slug": "permission-coin", "price": 0.00180328358477, "priceChangePercentage24h": -0.7286879, "priceChangePercentage7d": -4.28409158}, {"id": 1437, "name": "Zcash", "slug": "zcash", "price": 111.57714300688096, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.73640557, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.22958686}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 391, "name": "CoinTiger", "slug": "cointiger"}, {"id": 42, "name": "HitBTC", "slug": "hitbtc"}, {"id": 415, "name": "Bilaxy", "slug": "bilaxy"}, {"id": 403, "name": "BitForex", "slug": "bitforex"}, {"id": 400, "name": "Hotbit", "slug": "hotbit"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:05:37.348Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
