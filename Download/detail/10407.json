{"data": {"id": 10407, "name": "Baby Doge Coin", "symbol": "BabyDoge", "slug": "baby-doge-coin", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is BabyDoge (BabyDoge)?\n\nBabyDoge is a meme cryptocurrency that seeks to improve upon Dogecoin by improving transaction speeds and adding more deflationary attributes that reward users. Like some other meme cryptocurrencies, Baby Doge awards users by giving them a percentage of every transaction that occurs. That means users\u2019 wallets will receive BabyDoge automatically over time. This reflection encourages more supporters and holders of the coin. BabyDoge bills itself as a \u201chyper-deflationary\u201d crypto, meaning it will become increasingly more valuable and scarce over time. \n\nBabyDoge was launched in June 2021 and has an ambitious roadmap that includes further efforts for pet charity, NFT marketplace creation, and listing on major centralized crypto exchanges.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of BabyDoge?\n\nAs with other meme cryptocurrencies, it is unclear who the creators and main team behind BabyDoge are. These developers built BabyDoge using the Binance Smart Chain to create an ecosystem that is still Ethereum-compatible. Since its inception in June 2021, BabyDoge has amassed a community of 250k token holders, 85k Telegram members, 85k Twitter followers, and 45,000 Instagram followers. \n\n\n#### What Makes BabyDoge Unique?\n\nBabyDoge is focused on increasing the value of the crypto for its users while donating some proceeds to save dogs along the way. It is also focused on increasing transaction times and improving speeds. Like its \u201cfather,\u201d Dogecoin, BabyDoge seeks to bring its investors \u201cto the moon\u201d in terms of value. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\n[SHIBA INU](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/) \n\n[Floki Shiba](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/floki-shiba/) \n\n[Dogelon Mars](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogelon/)\n\n[Latest News](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/#blog) \n\n\n#### How Many BabyDoge Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere is a total supply of 420 quadrillion Baby Doge Coins with 295 quadrillion currently circulating \u2014 as 125 quadrillion (about 30%) have already been removed with [coin burning](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned). Baby Doge employs three functions to improve Baby Doge\u2019s scarcity and value: Reflection (adding coins to holders\u2019 wallets), LP acquisition (added as a liquidity pair on PancakeSwap), and coin burning. Of the 10% transaction fee, 5% is redistributed to Baby Doge Coin holders, and 5% is sold by the contract into BNB and added automatically as a liquidity pair on Pancake Swap.\n\nBaby Doge Coin also maintains a charity wallet with 2.2% of the total supply to donate to dog rescues and shelters. \n\n\n### How Is the Baby Doge Coin Network Secured?\n\nBaby Doge uses the [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) to provide a Proof of Staked Authority consensus that relies on 21 validators to provide decentralization and enable community involvement.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge)?\n\nIf you would like to buy Baby Doge, the top exchanges for trading in Baby Doge Coin are currently
