Our game will have all the features that traditional platforms have but it will be gathered all in one place.\n\nDFL is the native utility token that is used for:\n\n* Competing, betting, tipping.\n* trading in-game assets and NFTs.\n* Used for governance votes to determine how network resources are allocated.\n\n## What Makes DeFi Land Unique?\nThe amazing thing about our project is that we aren\u2019t creating closed ecosystem for our game as you may have seen in other protocols. We didn\u2019t want to create new environment but accelerate, gamify and improve already existing ones. DeFi Land will be running on top of established platforms, meaning users will be using well-known AMMs/DEXs/Lending protocols through our game. For example, when a player tries Yield Farming in our game one will actually be using different pools and staking platforms through our interface.\nIn DeFi Land, each asset will represent a currency. For example, in our demo SOL is Sunflower, USDC-corn, COPE- Pumpkin. These assets will be used to do the same activities as traditional DeFi offers as well as various different things we are about to reveal.\nDeFi Land is an ambitious game loaded with quite a few remarkable features. Our game will be launched in two versions, as v1.0 is coming out this summer while v2.0 is planned to be delivered by the start of 2022. It will be available for web as well as mobile phone users. All the game designs and mechanics are experimental and will be reiterated many times.\nDeFi Land v1\nRelaxing sounds, intuitive UI, pleasing environment\u2026Version 1 will feature the basic functionality of the Decentralized Finance protocols including:\n\n* Swap\n* Liquidity providing\n* Staking &Yield Farming\n* Governance\n* Customizable lands\n* Educational land (Practice Mode)\n* Achievements\n\nDeFi Land v2\nAs mentioned, our game will have two releases, as v2.0 is planned to come out at the start of 2022. Version 2 will include features that will finalize our project as a all-in-one gamified experience. v2 will have:\n\n* Lending & Borrowing\n* Indices\n* NFT marketplace\n* Interactive Chat\n* Predictions & Betting\n* Unions, clans and battling\n*Various fun mini games\n*Tournaments\n*Ethereum, Terra and BSC lands", "dateAdded": "2021-06-05T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "371", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-31T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [{"slug": "defi", "name": "DeFi", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "gaming", "name": "Gaming", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "solana-ecosystem", "name": "Solana Ecosystem", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://defiland.app/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://defiland.medium.com/introducing-defi-land-gamified-decentralized-finance-9d06c88d6369"], "chat": ["https://discord.gg/defiland", "https://t.me/defiland_official"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/defi_land"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.95012133608962, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.14534198, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.67063994}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.35385261564175, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.42971627, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.53591158}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04597065485341, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.9713895, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.70390874}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08818568964251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.68090104, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.9905728}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.85315809919322, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.59097836, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50061523}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884704433161, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.2284312, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.45313593}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:51:11.128Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
