{"data": {"id": 9462, "name": "Wrapped AVAX", "symbol": "WAVAX", "slug": "wavax", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Avalanche (AVAX)?\n\n[Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-avalanche) is an umbrella platform for launching decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) applications, financial assets, trading and other services.\n\nIt aims to be something of a global assets exchange, allowing anyone to launch or trade any form of asset and control it in a decentralized manner using smart contracts and other cutting-edge technologies.\n\nDevelopers at Ava Labs claim that Avalanche is the first smart contracts network to offer transaction finalization in under one second as standard.\n\nAvalanche launched its mainnet in September 2020. The platform\u2019s native token, AVAX, performs various tasks within Avalanche and also functions as a rewards and payment system for users.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Avalanche?\n\nAva Labs has three co-founders, among whom is [Emin G\u00fcn Sirer](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/02/28/professor-emin-gun-sirer-the-crypto-revolution-is-here-to-stay/), the veteran computer scientist long associated with Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) and decentralized networks.\n\nSirer has long been concerned with Bitcoin scaling, and the Avalanche Consensus is a direct follow-on from this research, allowing transaction volumes significantly higher than Bitcoin and competing with the likes of Visa.\n\nLike Sirer, fellow co-founders Kevin Sekniqi and Maofan \u201cTed\u201d Yin are also associated with Cornell University. Sirer is an advisor to Yin, who is undertaking a PhD in computer science.\n\nThe remainder of the team is made up of computer science, economics, finance and law experts.\n\n\n#### What Makes Avalanche Unique?\n\nAvalanche provides decentralized asset trading which anyone can launch and use, and does so with a network which is unique in the digital realm in providing subsecond transaction confirmations.\n\nDevelopers aim to bring together the huge, fragmented and often opaque world of asset trading under one roof, allowing barrier-free access. Developers can create and release all manner of entities from blockchains to digital representations of any asset, and allow them to trade according to any given parameters. These include, for example, mimicking compliance regulations in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe AVAX token forms the in-house payment method for Avalanche, and is used for fee collection during transactions, as well as for incentives and related purposes. Users can also earn passive income by staking their coins on the network.\n\n\n##### **Related Pages**:\n\nCheck out CMC Alexandria\u2019s deep dive into Avalanche [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-avalanche).\n\nRead more about Ethereum 2.0 [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/what-is-ethereum-2-0-why-is-it-important/).\n\nCheck out our interview with Emin G\u00fcn Sirer [here](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/02/28/professor-emin-gun-sirer-the-crypto-revolution-is-here-to-stay/).\n\nWant to learn more about Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies?

The genesis block contained half of that supply.\n\nThe other half will be released according to an emission curve detailed in the Avalanche whitepaper. A key difference to the emission of Bitcoin \u2014 which is unalterable \u2014 is that the AVAX release rate can be changed by community consensus. The supply cannot be changed; all that can differ from consensus is the rate at which the supply cap is reached.\n\nIn another contrast to Bitcoin and many other networks, transaction fees are \u201cburnt\u201d in order to increase token scarcity. This process is offset by the release, or \u201cminting,\u201d of new coins.\n\nTransaction fees themselves vary according to the type of operation that the AVAX transaction is performing on the Avalanche network. \n\n\n#### How Is the Avalanche Network Secured?\n\nAvalanche is a proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) protocol which rewards users for staking coins. PoS networks have come under fire for their low attack cost, which in some cases has exposed serious vulnerabilities.\n\nAccording to Ava Labs, Avalanche gets around this by changing governance to make it all but impossible for an attacker to covertly gain the necessary consensus.\n\n\n#### Where Can You Buy Avalanche (AVAX)?\n\nAVAX is a freely-exchangeable token and has made its way to major exchanges including Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to cryptocurrency, you can read more about how to buy Bitcoin or any other token [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).\n\"", "dateAdded": "2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:33:42.000Z", "watchCount": "315", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.avalabs.org/", "https://info.avax.network/#about"], "technical_doc": ["https://files.avalabs.org/papers/consensus.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://avascan.info/", "https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/tokens/0xB31f66AA3C1e785363F0875A1B74E27b85FD66c7/token-transfers"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/ava-labs"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/avalancheavax", "https://chat.avalabs.org/"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/Avax"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/AvalancheAVAX"]}, "volume": 3593701.7051574, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -31.4181, "statistics": {"price": 12.89033401506574, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.41555214, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.78836665, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.24378651, "priceChangePercentage30d": 15.50677707, "priceChangePercentage60d": -26.09591605, "priceChangePercentage90d": -58.67206606, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 2664, "low24h": 12.03946602, "high24h": 12.9171431, "low7d": 10.82964641, "high7d": 12.9171431, "low30d": 9.11766007, "high30d": 14.00724624, "low90d": 9.11766007, "high90d": 44.60618943, "low52w": 9.11766007, "high52w": 44.60618943, "lowAllTime": 9.11766007, "highAllTime": 44.60618943, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 41.38, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -71.1, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-20T10:16:09.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-05-07T13:23:05.000Z", "lowYesterday": 12.03946602, "highYesterday": 12.88550182, "openYesterday": 12.45275215, "closeYesterday": 12.88258526, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 3.45, "volumeYesterday": 4076895.25, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 5805, "contractAddress": "0xb31f66aa3c1e785363f0875a1b74e27b85fd66c7", "contractPlatform": "Avalanche Contract Chain", "contractPlatformId": 28, "contractChainId": -1, "contractRpcUrl": [], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": -1, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "", "contractExplorerUrl": "", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 5805}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.51961028446848, "priceChangePercentage24h": 40.05897643, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.08756307}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.09993818062774, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.86982167, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.75462837}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04639215361782, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13811962, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76587648}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34600204194768, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.31417693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.96994307}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08817176397124, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.22152403, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.30137851}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33359854728193, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.66084021, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.4943706}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.62329345078651, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.8204927, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.27014225}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12773403744909, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.63156837, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.11450108}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04584695150434, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.05885686, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.84051332}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:35:04.783Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "86", "credit_count": 0}}
