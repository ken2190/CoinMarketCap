{"data": {"id": 1698, "name": "Horizen", "symbol": "ZEN", "slug": "horizen", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Horizen (ZEN)?\n\nHorizen is an interoperable blockchain system, supported by a decentralized node infrastructure. Its sidechain platform focuses on scalable data privacy, and as such enables businesses as well as developers to build private or public blockchains using the unique sidechain technology known as Zendoo. \n\nHorizen launched in May of 2017 and strives to ensure data integrity and privacy through enabling real-world use cases. Horizen claims to be completely decentralized, fully customizable with privacy features and supports low costs associated with building blockchains with configurable revenue models and unlimited number of tokens and digital assets. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Horizen?\n\nThe founders of Horizen are Robert Viglione and Rolf Versluis.\n\nRobert Viglione is the co-founder and CEO of Horizen Labs, as well as the co-founder and president of the Zen Blockchain Foundation. He is a PhD Candidate of Finance in the University of South Carolina and worked as an operations research analyst at Lanmark Technology. He also worked as an advanced analyst at Tecolote Research and as a project manager at the United States Air Force.\n\nRolf Versluis is the co-founder and executive advisor of Zen Blockchain Foundation. He is an experienced business owner in the IT industry and owns a mid-size mining operation. In the past Rolf worked at Cisco systems, the semiconductor industry, and as a nuclear trained officer in the US Submarine force.\n\nJane Lippencott was a member of founding team and co-author of the original whitepaper. She is now an associate at Winklevoss Capital. She is also a 2021 VC Cohort at All Rise, as well as an advisor at Teller Finance. Jane is also a mentor at the Open Web Collective as well as a mentor at Celo and Katapult Accelerator. She is a contributor at Nakamoto.com. She worked as a mentor at Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition (BSIC), a mentor at dLab and a mentor at Ethereum Classic Labs, an advisor at Unbounded Capital, a mentor at Techstars, and was a member of the Board at Cord.\n\n\n## What Makes Horizen Unique?\n\nHorizen uses a sidechain architecture that can open up a myriad of potential real-world use cases. This cross-chain transfer protocol allows for decentralized sidechains. These are separate blockchains that are pegged to the parent blockchain that can run simultaneously. \n\nHorizen has a mission of empowering people and bringing them closer together through the process of building an inclusive ecosystem where everyone can be rewarded for their contribution. Zendoo is the decentralized and customizable sidechain solution used to overcome current limitations regarding scalability and extensibility in blockchain. It is a parallel platform with enhanced features that enables the deployment of public or private blockchains at scale, and the SDK provides the components required to build a decentralized blockchain. \n\nZEN is the native cryptocurrency for the Horizen ecosystem.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Alpha Finance Lab](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alpha-finance-lab/).\n\nLearn about [Diffract Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/diffract-finance/).\n\nLearn about non-fungible tokens (NFT) at [CMC Alexandria.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) \n\nMake sure to find our latest posts at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n## How Many Horizen (ZEN) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nHorizen has a large network with a multi-tiered node system. The operators receive 20% of the total block subsidy, and the dispersed node network provides a large infrastructure to operate an ecosystem of both applications and sidechains. \n\nWhen it comes to mining ZEN, it is an ASIC-mineable cryptocurrency that employs the Equihash algorithm. Block rewards 60% miners, 20% treasury and 20% nodes. \n\n\n## How Is the Horizen Network Secured?\n\nZEN uses the Equihash consensus algorithm. As such, Horizen can support ASIC mining. \n\nZEN uses secure nodes, which are crucial to the Horizen network. Secure nodes serve a unique purpose, and they have a TLS encryption that can enable secure inter-node communication.\n\nHorizen is also a Zcash fork, and as such it inherits the Zcash privacy technology, gaining shielded transactions that can mask the sender, recipient and value transacted. Zk-SNARKs are the core of these transactions and are developed by the Zcash team as a form of zero-knowledge cryptography.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Horizen (ZEN)?\n\nHorizen (ZEN) can be purchased, sold and traded at major cryptocurrency exchanges such as:\n\n[Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/)\n\n[Bithumb Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb-global/)\n\n[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n\n[Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/)\n\n[HitBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hitbtc/)\n\n[DigiFinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/digifinex/).\n\nYou can find others listed at the CMC [crypto exchanges page](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/).
