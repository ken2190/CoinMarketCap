{"data": {"id": 10971, "name": "Baby Cake", "symbol": "BABYCAKE", "slug": "baby-cake", "category": "token", "description": "BABYCAKE is the first CAKE reflection token.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Baby Cake](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/baby-cake/).\n\n\u201cHold BABYCAKE and get rewarded in CAKE on every transaction, automatically on your wallet.\u201d\n\nBABYCAKE is the next evolution of a yield-generating contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC): you get rewarded in CAKE instead of tokens.\n\nThe mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells). \n\nRedistribution is based on percentage (in the contract), current token balance and number of holders. You receive more tokens automatically.\n\nThe token contract employs a static rewards system of 15% of every transaction split in three : 7% CAKE redistribution + 3% Liquidity pool + 5% allocated to Marketing.\n\n7% Redistribution In CAKE:\n7% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders. Minimum 200,000 tokens.\n\nAuto Paid Every 60 Minutes:\nHolders don\u2019t need to claim their earned CAKE. \nIt\u2019s automatically sent to the wallets every 60 minutes.\n\nBNB Smart distribution:\nFor the first time ever, the holders don\u2019t need to buy tokens to be able to receive their rewarded tokens on their wallets.\n\n3% Auto Liquidity Pool:\n3% of every transaction is transformed into liquidity for Pancakeswap. It's automatic and helps create a price floor (stability).\n\nAnti-Swing feature:\nExtra 1% fee is applied to all sells. This will allow us to reduce swing-trading and break whales' control.\nTotal sell fee = 16% (7% CAKE redistribution + 3% Liquidity pool + 5% Marketing/Buyback).\n\nSecured By Design:\nInitial Liquidity Provided and Team tokens (5%) are locked with DXSALE for more than 6 months.\n\nMarketing Fees:\n5% of every transaction is allocated to Marketing in CAKE (swapped to CAKE in real time to avoid dumps). So we can fuel the most ambitious projects and reward our active community, on a daily basis.\n\n\nSmart distribution mechanism:\n- The contract keeps track in an array of all token holders.\n- The contract keeps an index into the array for processing.\n- Every transaction processes a certain number of users, depending on the transaction size (bigger token transfers can process more, since the gas will still be proportionally less than the value of the tokens).\n-The token is based on a Dividend-Paying Token Standard, which means all CAKE the contract gains will be split equally proportionally to the token holders.\n-When a user is processed, the contract checks how many withdrawable dividends they have, and if it is above the minimum threshold for auto-claims, will either automatically claim those dividends for CAKE, or automatically buy back tokens for them.\n-This system is fully automated and doesn't add minimal gas fees proportional to value transferred. \n-The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size. \n-Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the array. It's a fair system, fully automated.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:54:39.000Z", "watchCount": "19384", "dateLaunched": "2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://babycake.app/"], "technical_doc": ["https://babycake.app/white-paper/"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xdb8d30b74bf098af214e862c90e647bbb1fcc58c"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/babycakeBSC"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/BabyCakeBSC"]}, "volume": 6409465.43085408, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 77.0887, "statistics": {"price": 0.00054155828256, "priceChangePercentage1h": -8.85005995, "priceChangePercentage24h": 73.77523028, "priceChangePercentage7d": -20.44983092, "priceChangePercentage30d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 54155828.26, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 100000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 2623, "low24h": 0.00032781, "high24h": 0.00059974, "low7d": 0.00018051, "high7d": 0.00281332, "low30d": 5.21e-05, "high30d": 0.00281332, "low90d": 5.21e-05, "high90d": 0.00281332, "low52w": 5.21e-05, "high52w": 0.00281332, "lowAllTime": 5.21e-05, "highAllTime": 0.00281332, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 939.46, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -80.75, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-20T11:10:06.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-25T14:46:10.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00030275, "highYesterday": 0.00049934, "openYesterday": 0.00031324, "closeYesterday": 0.00041659, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 32.99, "volumeYesterday": 7332839.94, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xdb8d30b74bf098af214e862c90e647bbb1fcc58c", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xdb8d30b74bf098af214e862c90e647bbb1fcc58c", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.15277603529009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97491332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.15383074}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.34964051346751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.48864478, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65721962}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04606059556592, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.60454635, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.52026324}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35073162374456, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.29500189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.00533147}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08805508567185, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49406181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.66853882}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33953608915345, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.35932698, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.52614735}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.81208358366918, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.33740637, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.63805644}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884983830176, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.8379087, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.06023177}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05089512675303, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.36180993, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01964127}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:56:13.826Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
