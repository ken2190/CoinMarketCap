{"data": {"id": 5824, "name": "Smooth Love Potion", "symbol": "SLP", "slug": "smooth-love-potion", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Small Love Potion (SLP)?\n\nSmall Love Potion (SLP) tokens are earned by playing the Axie Infinity game. This digital asset serves a replacement for experience points.\n\nSLP are ERC-20 tokens, and they can be used to breed new digital pets that are known as Axies. The cost of breeding begins at 100 SLP but increases gradually \u2014 rising to 200 SLP for the second breed, 300 for the third, 500 for the fourth, 800 for the fifth and 1,300 for the sixth. Axies can be bred a maximum of seven times, and the seventh breed costs 2,100 SLP. This limit exists in order to prevent hyperinflation in the marketplace.\n\nIt can take time to accrue SLP through the game, and a player may need to win 15 competitions in order to gain enough tokens to perform their first breed. Purchasing SLP on the open market is a way for gamers to get a headstart.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Small Love Potion?\n\nA better question is this: who founded Axie Infinity? The CEO of the company behind the game is Trung Nguyen, who actually left his role as a software developer in the U.S. in order to focus on the project.\n\nAccording to Nguyen, he was motivated to explore blockchain\u2019s potential in gaming because he was frustrated at how many players don\u2019t truly own valuable assets in popular titles. [In an interview with Blockchain Gamer,](https://blockchaingamer.net/exclusive-interview-with-the-axie-infinity-team/) he said the Ethereum platform had given him the ultimate opportunity to create his \u201cdream game.\u201d\n\nNguyen says that the breeding process, for which SLP is used, is designed to be familiar to those who have played other collectible games such as CryptoKitties.\n\n\n#### What Makes Small Love Potion Unique?\n\nIt\u2019s fairly unusual for in-game currency to be listed on exchanges like SLP has. In a way, it\u2019s like Nintendo deciding to tie monetary value to the coins used in Super Mario. \n\nNguyen says Axies are different from other non-fungible tokens because of how they need to be nurtured if they are going to have any chance of reaching adulthood. \n\nSLP is also unique because of how it has become one of the few in-game tokens to be listed by Binance in its Innovation Zone. The exchange has reserved this trading category for assets \u201cthat are likely to have higher volatility and pose a higher risk than other tokens.\u201d\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nFind out about the [Axie Infinity (AXS) governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axie-infinity/).\n\nThe latest data about [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\n\nLearn about the magical world of cryptocurrencies with [CMC Alexandri\u0430.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/)\n\nRead the latest crypto news and analysis on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Small Love Potion (SLP) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nWhen it comes to tokenomics, the number of SLP in circulation is rather fluid. That\u2019s because of how these tokens are burned whenever new Axies are bred. Nonetheless, at the time of writing the circulating supply of SLP was in the tens of millions \u2014 and this ERC-20 token does not have a hard cap.\n\nIf the number of Axie Infinity players increase substantially, this could result in much higher levels of SLP entering into the ecosystem as more competitions are won and lost.\n\n\n### How Is the Small Love Potion Network Secured?\n\nSmall Love Potion doesn\u2019t have its own blockchain as it is an ERC-20 token \u2014 instead, it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Small Love Potion (SLP)?\n\nWhen SLP initially launched, it didn\u2019t actually have a fluctuating value as a cryptocurrency. However, this all changed when a liquidity pool for SLP was created on Uniswap. As we mentioned, the Binance Innovation Zone has unveiled support for the Pok\u00e9mon-inspired game. A single trading pair is offered, linking SLP with ETH.\n\nAll of this means that you may have a little difficulty purchasing SLP directly with fiat. As a result, you may need to convert your dollars, pounds or euros into a mainstream cryptocurrency such as Ethereum first.
