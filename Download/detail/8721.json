It is the need of the hour to protect investors. \r\n\r\nWhen a BEP-20 token or LP token is locked on the Wealth Platform, it\u2019s locking mechanism will be governed by our smart contract. The unlock date and other locking specifications pertaining to that token will be in-built in our smart contract. It will be accessible by all to view and will mark as a trust in projects investors and holders.\r\n\r\nFeatures of the Wealth locks Platform\r\n1. Tokens and liquidity lock- Locking tools make it fast, safe and assured to lock any BEP-20 based coin. Further locking projects token gives the investors faith that founders will not dump the project\u2019s token which will create a loss for the investors. Wealth locks help you lock your tokens with minimal fees of .5%.\r\n2. Lockup Dashboard- The moment you lock liquidity tokens with Wealth locks, it will show your lockup and project details in a very simple manner which makes it easier to gather information about the project which gives confidence to the investors and also ensures assurance.\r\n3. Secured and audited Smart Contracts-\r\nWealth locks respects security and decentralisation so we never have custody of users locked coins and do not have any access to them. The locking contract is well tested and audited for any security vulnerabilities. The locked tokens can only be withdrawn by the locking address after the completion of the lockup period.\r\n\r\nWealth token ($WLT) is the deflationary governance token of the wealth locks platform.  It is the integral part of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHow $WLT Works: There are 3 main functions\r\n1) Transfer Fee: There will be a 1% transaction fee for every transaction on $WLT which gets proportionally distributed among holders automatically (Similar to $RFI)\r\n\r\n2) Seller Fee: There will be extra added fee of 1% for sells on PancakeSwap. This added Fee increases by 1% with each sell and goes upto maximum of 5%. After Maximum, it again resets to 1%. This Fee amount gets collected in NextVault until transferred to new upcoming buyer. This transfer of seller fees to buyer is called Wealth Transfer.\r\n\r\nEligibility for Wealth Transfer:\r\nTo win the reward collected in NextVault. There is minimum buy condition of  1000 $WLT. So whenever there is a buy of 1000 $WLT, the wealth transfer is initiated and the tokens sitting in NextVault are transferred to the buyer.\r\n\r\nNextVault: 0xF47596080f65b872ADB1B1F6ce376cA2c06fd13F\r\n\r\n3) Bonus Event:\r\n At regular intervals a bonus event will be initiated by the team. During bonus event, if you buy more than 500 $WLT tokens, you automatically become eligible for claiming extra 100 tokens from BonusVault. Each bonus event will have maximum entrants limit of 5 which is on first buy first serve basis. \r\n\r\nThe time and criteria of each bonus event will be pre-announced so that everyone have fair chance to get in.", "dateAdded": "2021-03-08T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:29:07.000Z", "watchCount": "4319", "dateLaunched":
