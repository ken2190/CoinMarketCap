{"data": {"id": 495, "name": "I/O Coin", "symbol": "IOC", "slug": "iocoin", "category": "coin", "description": "Overview\n\niOC (I/O coin) is currently in steadfast development, upgrading it's open source blockchain protocol to host a fully private cryptocurrency. Enabling fully confidential, decentralized peer to peer digital payments. iOC currently fuels Dapps (decentralized applications) that take advantage of a full array of features, from encrypted document storage, encrypted transfer, identity storage to a fully encrypted messaging system. \n\nProfile \n\niOC was fair, launched on July 24th, 2014. iOC is a Privacy based cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem. iOC was initially launched via POW X11 algorithm. The difficult mining period lasted for 2 weeks. This was in order to properly and fairly distribute 16M coins before switching over to their own unique flavor of Proof of Stake Cipher. There are around 18 Million iOC in circulation with a maximum cap of 22 Million. The remaining iOC are minted via POS reward system for Stakers who work on confirming transactions. Stakers also receive transaction fees from on chain services. There is no governance model. The iOC community values freedom. The project was built with a free, fair minded and decentralized spirit. iOC was launched without any Initial Coin Offer (ICO) or Premine. \n\nIn 2015 iOC was the first project to move away from the Bitcoin QT wallet and replaced it with a unique \"fully decentralized\" HTML5/JS based UI wallet. Along with IONS DNS. In 2016 the iOC community and developers formed the I/O Digital foundation to further awareness of the open source public blockchain as it was done for Bitcoin, Litecoin and a few other fair launched projects. In 2017 I/O developers upgraded iOC's blockchain protocol to codename DIONS \"Decentralized Input Output Name Server\" further enhancing the base platform to host decentralized applications. \n\nWith the release of DIONS, the iOC Blockchain enabled identity storage. Users can store their own personal identification and be in full control of who can view it and who they want to share it with. It also allows storage of art and pictures including deeds, copyrights, trademarks, proof of ownership, data and much more. All of which are fully encrypted, fully controlled by the users private keys. \n\nIn addition the blockchain enabled features include, Private and Public identities, Stealth Addresses, AES 256 Encrypted 1MB Document/Data (upload, transfer via private users) capabilities, along with AES 256 Encrypted Instant Messaging. The I/O dev team also enabled and increased capacity to 4MB blocks with up to 16 second confirmation times. Along with our very own shuffle staking features. Ensuring that even low weighted users will always see a reward for their work. \n\nIn 2019, iOC's main focus continued a strong path towards privacy for all. Ensuring to serve as a privacy based economic and social platform. This by expanding their own privacy based mechanism in coding a Zero Knowledge protocol \"NightHawk\" ring signatures and Anon Balances. \n\nNightHawk protocol is currently on stand-by as the team is embarking on developing Non Turing Complete smart contracts to be deployed in 2021. The team will follow with a project codenamed \"Chameleon - a scalable entropy based molecular graph ledger, to advanced interoperability of multiple blockchains and deploy our own scalable virtual machine and I/O abstract smart contract Ecosystem\". The team will follow Chameleon with DIOEX. Essentially creating a completely private, secure and fully decentralized economic ecosystem.\n\niOC is a fully decentralized world wide cryptocurrency maintained by the I/O Digital Foundation and the iOC World Wide Community.", "dateAdded": "2014-08-02T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T08:30:39.000Z", "watchCount": "1766", "dateLaunched": "2014-07-24T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.0538221, "tags": [{"slug": "hybrid-pow-pos", "name": "Hybrid - PoW & PoS", "category": "CONSENSUS_ALGORITHM"}, {"slug": "x11", "name": "X11", "category": "CONSENSUS_ALGORITHM"}, {"slug": "filesharing", "name": "Filesharing", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["http://iocoin.io/"], "technical_doc": ["https://iodigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whitepaper_dions.pdf"], "explorer": ["http://chainz.cryptoid.info/ioc/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/IOCoin/DIONS"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/iocoin_official", "https://t.me/ioc_community"], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=695855.0"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/IOCoin_BlockChain"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/IOCoin_Official"]}, "volume": 2637.00915122, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 19.3921, "statistics": {"price": 0.0903544484469, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.31074099, "priceChangePercentage24h": -4.37474611, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.4305181, "priceChangePercentage30d": 5.35007801, "priceChangePercentage60d": -20.26843505, "priceChangePercentage90d": -61.53169754, "marketCap": 1718275.83, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": -4.365, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 19017058.47434563, "totalSupply": 19017058.47434563, "maxSupply": 0.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0001, "rank": 1446, "roi": 67.8761112, "low24h": 0.08213098, "high24h": 0.10685594, "low7d": 0.07046779, "high7d": 0.10685594, "low30d": 0.06048357, "high30d": 0.10685594, "low90d": 0.06048357, "high90d": 0.26106683, "low52w": 0.03766285, "high52w": 0.42132744, "lowAllTime": 0.0009543, "highAllTime": 7.69139004, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 9368.14, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -98.83, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2015-01-14T00:00:00.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2017-01-21T00:00:00.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.07493914, "highYesterday": 0.10662515, "openYesterday": 0.09522004, "closeYesterday": 0.10658666, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 11.94, "volumeYesterday": 1826.75, "turnover": 0.00153468, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 28.7378}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 5026, "name": "Orchid", "slug": "orchid", "price": 0.28629515116846, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.03584714, "priceChangePercentage7d": 2.2894955}, {"id": 3800, "name": "FidexToken", "slug": "fidex-token", "price": 2.95498945e-06, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.87759228, "priceChangePercentage7d": -86.10580932}, {"id": 5480, "name": "Bali Coin", "slug": "bali-coin", "price": 0.01835778023399, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.15118152, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.48956088}, {"id": 7141, "name": "Axioms", "slug": "axioms", "price": 0.01252052807223, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.47067561, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.62069111}, {"id": 4826, "name": "ZUM TOKEN", "slug": "zum-token", "price": 3.363833269e-05, "priceChangePercentage24h": 180.8898573, "priceChangePercentage7d": 21.38277578}, {"id": 2994, "name": "Bitcoin File", "slug": "bitcoin-file", "price": 0.00192611128582, "priceChangePercentage24h": 14.53473283, "priceChangePercentage7d": 30.97043066}, {"id": 6120, "name": "Anchor Neural World", "slug": "anchor-neural-world", "price": 0.04663650906002, "priceChangePercentage24h": 3.96702352, "priceChangePercentage7d": 5.76853755}, {"id": 2993, "name": "HorusPay", "slug": "horuspay", "price": 0.00492498241698, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.87759216, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.78492231}, {"id": 7812, "name": "SYNC Network", "slug": "sync-network", "price": 0.06547336214624, "priceChangePercentage24h": 95.3876823, "priceChangePercentage7d": 111.19089466}, {"id": 2843, "name": "Ether Zero", "slug": "ether-zero", "price": 0.00150865039492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.03572214, "priceChangePercentage7d": 9.09238533}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T08:32:06.473Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
