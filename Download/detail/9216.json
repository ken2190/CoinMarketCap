{"data": {"id": 9216, "name": "Coinbase tokenized stock Binance", "symbol": "COIN", "slug": "coinbase-tokenized-stock-binance", "category": "token", "description": "## What are Stock Tokens?\nStock tokens are tokens that closely track the performance of traditional financial securities, particularly shares of publicly traded companies. Stock tokens are delta-one products that are backed by physical shares. This means for a given instantaneous move in the price of the underlying asset there is expected to be an identical move in the price of the derivative.\n\n\n### Why trade Stock Tokens instead of shares?\nUnlike traditional stocks, users can purchase fractional shares of the listed companies with stock tokens. For instance, for a Tesla share that trades at over $700 per share, stock tokens enable investors to buy a piece of the underlying share (e.g., 0.01) instead of the entire unit.\nIn addition, Binance does not charge a commission for stock token transactions, offering traders the opportunity to save money on fees.\nToken holders will also enjoy benefits such as dividends and other economic benefits of holding the underlying stock. However, token holders are not entitled to voting rights.\n\n\n### How do Stock Tokens work?\nStock tokens are denominated, settled, and collateralized in BUSD; this makes the calculation of returns easier and quicker in fiat. Tokens are cash-settled, meaning there will be no physical redemption of underlying shares.\nStock tokens are created on collateral held by a third party. Therefore, each token represents a share in a publicly listed company. This way, the token\u2019s price is pegged to the price of the underlying shares.\n\n\n### How are Stock Tokens regulated?\nEach token is fully backed by shares held by, CM-Equity AG, a licensed and fully regulated asset management firm in Germany. CM-Equity AG entrusts the acquired shares to a third-party brokerage firm for custody. In addition, CM-Equity AG will be monitoring all trading activity for compliance.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-14T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "242", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/1f4b8036e43049baa612ba3c2dc07f16"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/binanceexchange"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/binance"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.24166129120971, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.34272879, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.14597679}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.05945464255914, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.72068904, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.69674765}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04646020423439, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.24519143, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.93829757}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34543127132665, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.10634214, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.07975349}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08848357044107, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.68926522, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.90068823}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33655507262923, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.51260811, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.6367239}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.6049363775859, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.53740765, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.20416456}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12785422107494, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.99760207, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.70459243}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04698230570444, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32158169, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.92562492}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:33:14.035Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
