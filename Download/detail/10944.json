We know the community is fired up for this launch, but you\u2019ll have to be quick \u2014 the whitelist staking event is only open for 24 hours.\n\nThe whitelist event is less than 24 hours away, so let\u2019s run through the essential details of the inaugural whitelist staking event on Apollo-X.\n\nKey Details for the OMNI Whitelist Event:\nWhitelist staking event commences \u2014 1 PM UTC on Wednesday, July 14\nWhitelist staking event closes \u2014 1 PM UTC on Thursday, July 15\nNumber of $OMN tokens available \u2014 10,000,000\nToken launch price \u2014 $0.02\nCombined offering value \u2014 $200,000\nInitial circulating market cap \u2014 $189,700\n\nOnce you\u2019ve staked your PAID tokens in the appropriate pool, you have a chance to join the whitelist. Staking occurs on Ethereum, and the staked tokens are locked for 14 days, so you can\u2019t use them to participate in other Apollo-X or Ignition pools during that time.\n$OMN tokens are issued on Binance Smart Chain, and payment for the IDO occurs during the OMNI Launch Party on July 16th at 1:30 pm UTC. Pools open during the launch event, so make sure you attend the event to secure your token allocation.\n\nThe only form of payment accepted is $BNB, so you\u2019ll need to fund your associated Binance Smart Chain account to participate in the sale.\nIf you stake $PAID but miss the launch event, your tokens remain staked for 14 days. Once the whitelist is confirmed, you still need to join the OMNI Launch Party before the $OMN token listing to pay for your tokens, or you\u2019ll miss your allocation.\nMake sure you KYC by July 14th at 1 PM UTC, or you will not be able to join the IDO.\n\nIf you are KYC\u2019d for Ignition, your KYC will work on the Apollo-X platform. If you haven\u2019t completed the KYC, you can sign-up over at PAID Network.", "fundraisingGoalUsd": "200000", "whereToBuyName": "Apollo-X", "whereToBuyUrl": "https://apollox.paidnetwork.com/project/omni", "acceptedCurrency": "BNB"}]}, "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "distributions": [{"holder": "Seed Sale", "percentage": 6.95}, {"holder": "Seed Sale", "percentage": 9.93}, {"holder": "Private Sale", "percentage": 9.52}, {"holder": "Public Sale", "percentage": 1.57}, {"holder": "Team", "percentage": 10.0}, {"holder": "Advisors", "percentage": 5.0}, {"holder": "Community", "percentage": 3.0}, {"holder": "Community", "percentage": 20.0}, {"holder": "Foundation", "percentage": 5.0}, {"holder": "Foundation", "percentage": 29.03}], "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:56:02.154Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
