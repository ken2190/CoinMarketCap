It describes itself as a fully encompassing finance on the blockchain. The COTI Group launched in March of 2017, while the Staking Platform Launched on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nIt is an ecosystem that is designed specifically to meet all of the challenges associated with traditional finance, including latency, fees, global inclusion and risks. This is done through the introduction of the DAG-based protocol as well as infrastructure that is completely scalable, private, inclusive and fast.\n\nThe ecosystem has DAG-based blockchain, proof-of-trust consensus algorithm, multiDAG, GTS (Global Trust System), a universal payment solution and a payment gateway. \n\n\n## Who are The Founders of OTI?\n\nCOTI was founded by Samuel Falkon and David Assaraf.\n\nSamuel Falkon is the co-founder of COTI Group and works as the VP of business development at COTI Group.  He is also the chief revenue officer at Paywize, as well as the founder of Gil Scott Ltd. \n\nDavid Assaraf is the co-founder of COTI Group, and he also co-founded Frequants and was a member at the board of directors at an amusement park.\n\n\n## What Makes COTI Unique?\n\nThe thing that makes COTI unique is COTI\u2019s platform.\n\nThis platform enables companies to effortlessly create advanced fintech products and save time, data and money. COTI pay can process every kind of payment type, both in terms of online payments as well as offline ones. This includes crypto and stablecoins, as well as credit cards and even native coins. It has built-in financing to boot, with interest earned on deposits and loans. This also connects with the white label payment network. \n\nTraditional payment systems simply cost both merchants and customers amounts up to billions of dollars on an annual basis. As such, the white label payment network is a global payment network for users and merchants that make transactions freely throughout a digital wallet, coin and much more. \n\nCOTI is also the world\u2019s first platform that is optimized for the creation of coins that are stable in price. As such, a user has the ability to issue their own stable coin and regain full control over both their money and their data.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Terra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/).\n\nLearn about [Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/).\n\nLearn about algorithmic stablecoins on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-stable-are-algorithmic-stablecoins-flipside-crypto).\n\nEnhance your knowledge of cryptocurrencies on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n## How Many COTI (COTI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nCOTI (COTI) has a maximum supply of 2,000,000,000 COTI coins.\n\n\n## How Is the COTI Network Secured?\n\nCOTI has an infrastructure that is based on the DAG protocol and their Trustchain algorithm. Above this infrastructure layer lies the services layer known as Coti X. Coti X offers KYC and compliance, interoperability exchange, buyer-seller protections and stability frameworks. Then you have the COTIPLAY layer, which offers externally developed stable coins, externally developed payment apps and much more.\n\nCOTI uses a hash table as its data structure which is based on chaining. This means that the blockchain itself can secure the computing and privacy of customers. The COTI protocols have made the system a lot more secure for both buyers and sellers. \n\nAs such, COTI has an ecosystem that provides robust cybersecurity measures around data integrity as well as confidentiality. \n\nThe COTI wallet is based on the React Native Framework and provides cross-platform functionality and portability. The COTI wallet requires user credentials and is paired with 2FA login in order to establish a connection with the node manager. Once this is established, all communication requires the wallet\u2019s seed. This means that all of the messages are validated and no spoofing or manipulation is possible within this system.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy COTI (COTI)? \n\nWhen it comes to trading, buying or selling COTI, you can find it at the following exchanges:\n\n[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n\n[VCC
