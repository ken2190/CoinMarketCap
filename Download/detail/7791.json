{"data": {"id": 7791, "name": "Pancake Bunny", "symbol": "BUNNY", "slug": "pancakebunny", "category": "token", "description": "What Is PancakeBunny (BUNNY)?\nPancakeBunny is a decentralized finance (DeFi) yield aggregator and optimizer for the Binance Smart Chain, which is used for PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Venus (XVS), and will soon launch on Polygon (MATIC). The PancakeBunny protocol gives farmers the opportunity to reap the benefits of auto compounding. \n\nPancakeBunny is one of the largest yield aggregators across ETH and BSC, in terms of TVL. \nFarmers at PancakeBunny get permission from private individuals for automatic summation and reinvestment of yield on their behalf through mono-contracts. Users can farm on their own, but doing so involves a complex process of determining the optimal frequency and time at which to increase and reinvest profitability. With PancakeBunny users can delegate this process. The actual farming takes place on PancakeSwap and Venus.\n\nThe primary goal of the platform is to support the DeFi ecosystem by providing users with an easy way to automatically increase their profitability on Binance Smart Chain. The team has a mission of lowering the barrier to entry to DeFi. \n\n\nWho Are the Founders of PancakeBunny?\n\nPancakeBunny is built by MOUND. MOUND is the innovative team behind Pancake Bunny, one of the leading Defi platforms on the Binance Smart Chain. MOUND is dedicated to putting compounding, high-yield returns in the palm of everyone\u2019s hand. Team MOUND is composed of developers and entrepreneurs with extensive experience and success in games, social platforms, quantitative financial services, and blockchain applications. Team MOUND is committed to creating value through product innovation (such as $BUNNY tokenomics and the Cake Maximizer) and an unrelenting focus on the user. Team MOUND\u2019s impressive product portfolio includes Single Asset Smart Vaults, ETH-BSC Cross-Chain Farming, and a new Lending Service called Qubit. The team is working on expanding to Polygon, introducing an innovative financial product called  the MND token, which will allow users to reap the benefits of all the different projects created by MOUND, by holding just a single token. Mound has a strategic investment partnership with Binance Labs. \n\n\n\nWhat Makes PancakeBunny (BUNNY) Unique?\n\nOwners of BUNNY tokens control the ecosystem of PancakeBunny and receive most of the profits from farming rewards. BUNNY holders place their tokens in the BUNNY staking pool to claim the profit, which is sent to the pool in the form of Binance Coin (WBNB) rewards. The share of profit received by a participant is proportional to the size of their BUNNY stake: the more tokens you stake, the higher your impact on the ecosystem. BUNNY holders can also vote on various proposals on the snapshot page to voice their opinions. \n\n\nHow Many PancakeBunny (BUNNY) Coins Are There in Circulation?\nThe BUNNY token doesn\u2019t have a maximum supply. Instead, every time the 30% performance fees are collected and distributed to BUNNY holders, the protocol mints 36% in Bunny at the market price, to ensure competitive compensation to liquidity providers.\n\nThe token\u2019s fee structure is as follows: 30% is allocated as a performance fee for the processing of BUNNY transactions and 0.5% is charged as a withdrawal fee if the withdrawal takes place within 72 hours of deposit. \n\nThe 30% performance fee is given to the BUNNY stakers. Ultimately, all fees are used as rewards for staking BUNNY \u2014 an approach that is expected to ensure the sustainability and longevity of PancakeBunny. In exchange for paying the 30% performance fee, users of non BUNNY pools receive 36% of profits in BUNNY at the time of claim or withdrawal, giving a 6% bonus incentive.\n\n\n", "dateAdded":
