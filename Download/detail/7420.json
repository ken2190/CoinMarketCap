It was created during the COVID-19 crisis when fiscal and monetary policies have exposed serious vulnerabilities in the current financial system. The concept of the Digital Reserve Currency was developed by Maxim Nurov, CEO of Digital Finance, Washington, DC, a financial company that specializes in the digital assets market.\n\nYou can learn more about DRC at the official website https://drcglobal.org\n\n\n## How is Digital Reserve Currency (DRC) innovative?\n\nDRC has a few unique characteristics that differentiate it from other digital assets. First, DRC has a purely deflationary economic model. 100% of the total DRC supply was issued to the secondary market and no more DRC tokens will ever be created.\n\nSecond, DRC has a fair distribution model. All the DRC supply of 1 Billion indivisible tokens was issued directly to the market. DRC founders/developers never received any funds from investors in any form and never retained any tokens before the whole token supply became available on the market.\n\nThird, DRC had a community-driven ecosystem from the day one. No one has control over DRC as DRC has fully decentralized structure. The DRC Foundation has been created by the DRC community to define the strategy and the road map of the DRC ecosystem development.\n\n\u200cFinally, the DRC token is fully developed and operational. Its smart contract has been audited by a trusted blockchain development firm and does not contain any security issues. Built using Solidity, DRC\u2019s code cannot be altered since being deployed on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n## What is the value proposition of Digital Reserve Currency (DRC)?\n\nDRC has a robust value proposition as a potential digital store of value. As global markets experience inflation, DRC provides economic scarcity and a zero-inflation rate. In accordance with the DRC road map, DRC holders should be able to link the value of their tokens to a basket of the most efficient store of value assets such as gold, Bitcoin, and the US dollar, as soon as in Q1 2021.\n\n\n## What is the mission of Digital Reserve Currency (DRC)?\n\nDRC was designed to provide a steady increase in its intrinsic value and act as a useful hedge against inflation. It fits the needs of people looking to preserve their wealth, especially in developing countries, while still having the flexibility of immediate, cross-border, and censorship-resistant transfers.\n\n\n## What is the DRC Foundation?\n\nThe DRC Foundation is a non-official, community-led organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of the DRC ecosystem. The DRC Foundation role is not to control or manage the DRC network, as it is fully decentralized. Our mission is to advocate for the DRC ecosystem and to facilitate its global adoption and success.\n\nYou can learn more about the DRC Foundation at https://drc.foundation\n\n\n### Where Can I find
