Deploy a 24 hour time lock contract.\r\nAny changes made to the smart contract will be delayed by 24 hours.\r\nWe will implement this after we have introduced all our pools and we confirm the rewards are working as expected. This is 5x longer than all the other protocols. Any changes to the contracts such as adding a new pool will be communicated to the community.\r\nWe have removed the Migrator function from the Masterchef contract, now you won\u2019t have to worry about your funds when farming.\r\nRemoving the Migrator function and implementing a Timelock of 24 hours removes entirely the risk of a rug pull as we want FENIX farmers to farm without risks.",

For the first two hours only tier club members can buy tokens based on the max purchase amount.\nIf some tokens remain after those two hours, then all users can buy. These sales are also controlled by the max amount concept, but with a 10% increase in prices. Token sales last at most 48 hours.\n\nIf you are a higher Club member, then you can buy more Tokens:\n\nJulPad Club (Tier 1): Max Purchase Amount *1\nJulPad Club (Tier 2): Max Purchase Amount *2\nJulPad Club (Tier3): Max Purchase Amount *3\nJulPad Club (Tier4): Max Purchase Amount *4\n\nThere are two possible token sale end scenarios: either your tokens sell out, or don\u2019t. In both cases, the trading pair token/BNB will be created on JulSwap based on your settings. The trading pair gets created 48 hours after the Token Sale start time.\n\nHow is the total supply calculated?\n\nSample: The Project mentions in the token sale that they want to use 10,000 tokens, which is 10% of the total supply, for token sale, 40% for Marketing (including Team, Exchanges and other) & 50% for the Liquidity.\nIf the token sale is a 100% sold out, then the total supply will be 100,000 tokens.\n10% Token Sales = 10,000 Tokens\n40% Marketing = 40,000 Tokens\n50% Liquidity = 50,000 Tokens\n\nHowever, if the token sale is only 50% sold out, then the total supply will be 50,000 tokens. This is because the percentages are measured on the token sale result.\n\nTokens can be claimed by the buyers directly after creating the trading pair.\n\n48 hours after the Token Sale end, 10% of the raised amount gets distributed back to tier club members in JULb who invested into the project (buy back JULb with BNB).\n\nHere\u2019s how tier club members are decided, and the amount of JULb each club will have:\n\nJulPad Club (Tier 1) : 25 JULb \u2014 10%\nJulPad Club (Tier 2) : 100 JULb \u2014 25%\nJulPad Club (Tier3): 500 JULb \u2014 30%\nJulPad Club (Tier4): 2,500 JULb \u2014 35%\n\nIf you are wondering how can users join a given club, here\u2019s the answer: locking JULb. The more a user holds JULb, the higher their rank. But if a user unlocks his assets earlier than expected, then, a penalty fee must be paid:\n\nless than 10 Days \u2014 30%\nless than 20 Days \u2014 25%\nless than 30 Days \u2014 20%\nless than 60 Days \u2014 10%\nless than 90 Days \u2014 5%\nafter 90 Days \u2014 0%\n", "fundraisingGoalUsd": "900000.0", "whereToBuyName": "JulPad IDO", "whereToBuyUrl": "https://julpad.com/presale/proj26", "acceptedCurrency": "BNB"}]}, "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "distributions": [{"holder": "Advisors", "percentage": 5.0}, {"holder": "Community", "percentage": 5.0}, {"holder": "Foundation", "percentage": 60.0}, {"holder": "Public Sale", "percentage": 15.0}, {"holder": "Team", "percentage": 15.0}], "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:49:55.478Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "21", "credit_count": 0}}
