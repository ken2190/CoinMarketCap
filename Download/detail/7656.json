{"data": {"id": 7656, "name": "Mercurity Swap Protocol", "symbol": "MEE", "slug": "mercurity-swap-protocol", "category": "token", "description": "Mercurity is an open DeFi platform powered by swap. The most important problems we aim to solve are: low capital utilization, impermanent loss risk, and poor community governance capabilities. We\u2019re starting with DeFi, aiming to provide the most open, flexible, autonomous, and comprehensive DeFi trading and liquidity services to retail consumers anywhere, anytime. But that\u2019s just the beginning of our story\u2026\r\n\r\nOur Mission\r\nTo build the most global, unified, and diverse DeFi ecosystem by connecting the world\u2019s best DEXs and DeFi communities across the globe.\r\n\r\nOur Vision\r\nTo unlock and accelerate access to new financial value for anyone, anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s Most Special About Mercurity.Finance?\r\nAutonomous Governance.\r\nWe aim to empower liquidity pools with an unprecedented level of autonomous governance options and growth incentives. For example, we\u2019ll provide each liquidity pool with its own General Partner (GP) and governance capabilities such as setting transaction fees, pool access requirements, trading rules, and voting rights.\r\n\r\nPair Tokens.\r\nOur big DEX innovation is Pair Token, an incentive token for liquidity providers that enables unprecedented governance of individual liquidity pools.\r\nUnbundled, Better Segmented Services.\r\n\r\nTraders often want lower transaction fees, while liquidity providers want relatively high fees to compensate for their impermanent losses. In addition, some traders prefer or need to trade with counterparties that have gone through KYC / AML compliance requirements, while other retail users prefer the speed and anonymity of bypassing a burdensome KYC process.\r\nTo address this conflict between different user group\u2019s needs, we believe unbundling and better segmenting features will allow us to better serve specific user groups\u2019 needs. We aim to accomplish this by leveraging the synergistic value of multiple AMM protocols: swap, lending, impermanent loss insurance, and synthetic assets.\r\nMultiple Protocols. Seamless Integration.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re launching multiple protocols \u2014 swap, lending, impermanent loss insurance, and synthetic assets \u2014 designed to operate independently or work together seamlessly on various DEXs to provide more value. For example, a stablecoin liquidity provider (LP) could also become an LP of a lending or insurance liquidity pool too. Mercurity empowers liquidity providers to reuse its various LP tokens across multiple protocols to maximize yield.\r\nTrade Mining\r\n\r\nWhile traders on DEXs bear higher gas fees and potentially larger price slippages than on CEXs, platforms like Uniswap do not compensate traders. In contrast, Mercurity considers traders to be as important as liquidity providers and therefore, plans to ensure that traders receive DFM token rewards based on their trading activity.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nA quick overview of the key features planned for Mercurity.Finance:\r\n\r\nSwaps (Mercurity Swap Protocol) \u2014 Be a General Partner (GP) of your very own liquidity pool. Set your transaction fees. Get the best asset prices across pools with our on-chain smart order routing (SOR) engine. Mercurity Swap enables community autonomy for each liquidity pool. Each pool is like an independent fund, and Mercurity Swap becomes the infrastructure for ETF funds, helping to build an ecosystem that allows everyone to create and operate an ETF fund.\r\n\r\nLending (Mercurity Lend Protocol) \u2014 Stake your LP tokens to earn interest and lending pool governance tokens from lent trading pairs. Mercurity Liquidity Lend Protocol is a fully decentralized, money market protocol for staking LP tokens to lending trading pair assets. The Mercurity Lending protocol is designed to improve the LP\u2019s capital utilization and allow lending users to obtain liquidity benefits from impermanent losses.\r\n\r\nImpermanent Loss Insurance (Mercurity Insurance Protocol) \u2014 Stake LP tokens to earn premiums and insurance pool governance tokens. Pay premiums with your LP tokens to lower impermanent losses.\r\n\r\nSynthetics (Mercurity Synthetic Asset Protocol) \u2014 Issue synthetic assets based on your risk appetite and investment preferences.", "dateAdded": "2020-11-12T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-05-13T01:51:07.000Z", "watchCount": "784", "dateLaunched": "2020-11-06T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "selfReportedTags": ["DEX", "LP Tokens", "Yield farming", "DeFi", "Insurance"], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.mercurity.finance/"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.mercurity.finance/en/core-products/mercurity-swap"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0xe1b583dc66e0a24fd9af2dc665f6f5e48978e106"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/MER-DAO"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/mercurityfinance"], "chat": ["https://t.me/mercurityfinance"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/MercurityDefi"]}, "volume": 0.0, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0xe1b583dc66e0a24fd9af2dc665f6f5e48978e106", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0xe1b583dc66e0a24fd9af2dc665f6f5e48978e106", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 4041, "name": "MX Token", "slug": "mx-token", "price": 0.59240324686383, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.95158906, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.38186829}, {"id": 1788, "name": "Metal", "slug": "metal", "price": 2.06708325878259, "priceChangePercentage24h": 14.40908596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.5004029}, {"id": 6622, "name": "Hakka.Finance", "slug": "hakka-finance", "price": 0.02312373171741, "priceChangePercentage24h": -3.66894426, "priceChangePercentage7d": -6.59943896}, {"id": 5956, "name": "MCDEX", "slug": "mcdex", "price": 32.85008248566126, "priceChangePercentage24h": 37.40299613, "priceChangePercentage7d": 129.91870393}, {"id": 1169, "name": "PIVX", "slug": "pivx", "price": 0.58321285683194, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.83395632, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.97495355}, {"id": 328, "name": "Monero", "slug": "monero", "price": 247.794716778285, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.24619219, "priceChangePercentage7d": 21.59673101}, {"id": 1, "name": "Bitcoin", "slug": "bitcoin", "price": 41763.14981098448, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.10232751, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.13196571}, {"id": 3911, "name": "Ocean Protocol", "slug": "ocean-protocol", "price": 0.48481326083925, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.90189558, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.07215021}, {"id": 3992, "name": "COTI", "slug": "coti", "price": 0.14079443351896, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.57517479, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.70387205}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:22:08.309Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
