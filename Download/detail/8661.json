{"data": {"id": 8661, "name": "Vortex Defi", "symbol": "VTX", "slug": "vortex-defi", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Vortex DeFi (VTX)?\n\nVortex DeFi is an all-in-one decentralized finance solution aiming to bring together all [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) tools into a single platform. Launched in August 2020, Vortex DeFi successfully creates an intersection between the [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/) and [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) ecosystems by presenting a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based decentralized financial platform. \n\nFocusing on a wide range of financial operations, including [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) asset tracking, lending and insurance of crypto assets, Vortex DeFi aims to become a decentralized finance industry leader. By combining a multitude of financial tools, the platform aims to bring increased usability for both its private and enterprise clients. Last but not least, Vortex DeFi seeks to present the best yielding opportunities to yield farmers automatically.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Vortex DeFi?\n\n[Rahul Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulfromsymbioisis/) is the founder and CEO of Vortex DeFi. With a long resume of interesting positions behind him, Singh decided to combine his knowledge and professional experience to create the ultimate DeFi platform.\n\nHe graduated with a degree in business administration from Symbiosis International University in 2009. Immediately after graduating, Singh jumped into business-related roles, becoming a business analyst for Searce Inc. Later on, in 2011, he joined Infosys, where he moved up the ladder to become a senior associate consultant. Singh\u2019s last official position before founding Vortex DeFi, which he still holds to this day, is as a technical product owner for Honeywell. Focusing predominantly in the aerospace domain, Mr. Singh is responsible for overseeing the implementation of Honeywell products and their distribution through e-commerce tools. \n\nOther important figures in the Vortex DeFi team include [Lester Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesterlim15/), a strategic advisor for the project, and [Arun Sunil R Lobo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-sunil-r-lobo-2904a04/), the technical lead for the platform.  \n\n\n#### What Makes Vortex DeFi Unique?\n\nVortex DeFi aims to make it as easy as possible for the end-user to benefit from a wide range of financial tools. DeFi is an extremely complex universe, and the variety of use cases usually presents to be intimidating, even for seasoned investors and active crypto users. This is where Vortex DeFi makes a difference.\n\nBy combining the Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems\u2019 capabilities, Vortex DeFi creates an array of DeFi tools, instruments and protocols, including NFT trading, asset swapping and yield farming. Not only that, Vortex DeFi has an ambitiously designed road map ahead, featuring capabilities like fiat ramp-ups and crypto cross-chain swapping. Vortex DeFi combines all the latest developments in decentralized finance and ensures that future improvements are seamlessly integrated within the platform.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Nexo](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nexo/).\n\nFind out more about [NEAR Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/).\n\nLearn more about [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-access-dapps-on-your-mobile-phone).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Vortex DeFi (VTX) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nVortex DeFi has announced a total and maximum supply of 100,000,000 VTX tokens. At the moment, the circulating supply amounts to about 13,625,000 VTX tokens. \n\nOf the total VTX supply, about 32.5% were reserved for private sales and seed funding rounds. Another 20% of the total supply was designated as a rewards pool for the founding team and advisors on the project. As a utility token, VTX requires a set amount of tokens dedicated to a rewards reserve. In this case, Vortex DeFi set aside 27% of the total supply for rewards reserve. Another 10% were distributed for marketing purposes, while 2.5% of the total supply went towards public sales. Finally, 8% of all tokens were set aside as a future reserve. \n\n\n### How Is the Vortex DeFi Network Secured?\n\nAs an Ethereum-based platform, with VTX being an [ERC-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20), Vortex DeFi relies on the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. Unlike blockchains which rely on a proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) mechanism, PoS creates block validators based on the size of the stake users have in the token and the amount of time they have held this stake. \n\nPoS blockchains require a lot less computing power to perform validations and transactions and use up less electricity for these processes. This makes them extremely scalable and opens up a multitude of use cases before developers. Considering these advantages, Vortex DeFi banked on the versatility of PoS and the interoperability it offers. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Vortex DeFi (VTX)?\n\nVTX coins are relatively accessible for purchase, as they are ERC-20 tokens. One of your solid choices is [Uniswap v2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), which has the largest trade volume of VTX tokens as of March 2021.\n\nAnother choice for purchasing VTX is [1inch Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/1inch-exchange/), which has the second-largest trading volume as of March 2021. Of course, it is crucial to note that investing in cryptocurrency can be risky, as coin prices are incredibly volatile. \n\n[Find more information](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) on
