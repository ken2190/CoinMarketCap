{"data": {"id": 8265, "name": "Helmet.insure", "symbol": "HELMET", "slug": "helmet-insure", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Helmet.insure (HELMET)?\n\nHelmet.insure is a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) (P2P) price-shield insurance protocol launched in January 2021 on [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) (BSC) with the aim to redefine option trading with user-friendly insurance policy wrapping.\n\nHelmet allows users to create an insurance policy for any crypto asset in the market, protecting [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) users against the risk of price fluctuations. Policy trading on Helmet is market-oriented without complex mathematics. There are two kinds of policy on Helmet: SHORT Tokens and LONG tokens.\n\nHelmet also adds a mining part in its hedging tool, allowing DeFi users to enjoy yield farming while trading. Helmet supports different tokens like [Ether ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)(ETH), [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/) and [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/). Users can swap the tokens by connecting their wallets to the platform. \n\nHelmet received strategic funding from [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) in March 2021 to provide a more competitive option and insurance protocol for cross-chain and on-chain trading. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Helmet.insure?\n\nHelmet.insure is a Binance Smart Chain-based P2P protocol launched by anonymous developers with a passion to redefine option trading for DeFi users.  \n\n\n#### What Makes Helmet.insure Unique?\n\nHelmet intends to create a platform where a crypto trader or holder can issue an advance price-based insurance that could hedge price fluctuation and offer rewards simultaneously. Helmet specializes in providing price shield insurance for [BSC ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain)assets, including diverse insurance depending on token holders and traders. \n\nUsers can also have two roles as either a policy supplier or policy holder. \n\nA policy supplier is the creator and seller of an insurance policy. Suppliers earn Helmet token as rewards for creating selling orders to the market. In contrast, Holders buy the insurance policy from suppliers. Once the insurance policy matures, they can choose to claim or abstain from the insurance based on the swap price. \n\nHelmet redefines option trading, ensuring that option tokens do not rely on oracles or admin, but operate independently as a [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). It also provides unique insurance that is designed by policy suppliers ensuring they can flexibly assemble the parameters of an insurance policy. Anyone can participate in this market and earn rewards by simply depositing an underlying token asset. \n\nEach policy option is endorsed at the nominal value held by users, eliminating counterparty risks and ensuring that the option holder can always purchase the underlying token. Helmet also has a mining aspect that adds extra features, and users can mine HELMET tokens. \n\nHelmet is also open to all DeFi protocols and users can earn rewards based on their activities within the platform. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Terra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/).\n\nLearn about [InsurAce](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/insurace/)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.</span>\n\nLearn about Crypto ETFs on [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-etf).\n\nStay in the loop about everything cryptocurrency on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Helmet.insure (Helmet) Coins Are There in Circulation\n\nHELMET is the governance token issued by helmet.insure and has a total supply of 100 million.
