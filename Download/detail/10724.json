{"data": {"id": 10724, "name": "SolarWind Token", "symbol": "SLW", "slug": "solarwind-token", "category": "token", "description": "SolarWind Token provides a decentralized way for people to get financed for solar projects. Through our dApp, the full process of financing a project from start to finish is 100% trackable on the Binance blockchain. We have a dedicated project fund wallet that will be used to pay the solar installer of the customer\u2019s choice. Every new installer will be required to create a wallet and have it listed with the company name on our website. The funds will be paid to the installer according to the project milestones. Upon project completion, the customer will be able to make payments directly into the liquidity pool with a credit or debit card via our dApp. The dApp can also be blended into new and existing Bitcoin miners\u2019 liquidity pools to provide them with solar installations to accelerate Bitcoin\u2019s transition to renewable energy. This will create an automatic payment method for the miners as well as create a liquidity pool backed by Bitcoin for $SLW.\r\n\r\nWe also realize the importance of giving back to communities around the world. In Q3 2021 we will be establishing our own nonprofit, Positive Energy. 5% of the funds deployed to the installers will be allocated to a charity wallet to fulfill missions around the world voted on by the community. Such missions will consist of a wide variety of topics such as energy, health, hunger, homelessness, or more.\r\n\r\nAs the world transitions to renewable energy, homeowners, businesses, and governments are needing to transition into using solar energy. Millions of drivers are expected to switch to electric vehicles, and Bitcoin miners are seeking cleaner energy sources. This is a recipe for exponential growth in the solar industry which only has a market cap in the hundred billions, compared to the multi-trillion dollar energy sector. There have been many programs to help incentivize homeowners and businesses; however, it is difficult for many people to pay for an installation in cash or even to find financing to fund a project. \r\n\r\nSolarWind is the solution. This token provides a brand-new way for people to invest in the solar industry, gives customers and installers easy financing, accelerates Bitcoin\u2019s transition to renewable energy, and helps governments with their goals to reduce carbon emissions. Holders have the opportunity to grow with the token in four different ways:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe 5% redistribution allows holders to accumulate more tokens the longer they hold from every single transaction of the token.\r\n2.\tThe liquidity pool will be increasing after project completion because as customers complete their payments, more money will be put back into the pool than was originally used. This adds a traditional form of investing because holders can indirectly earn interest through the liquidity pool.\r\n3.\tRenewable energy as a whole still plays such a small role in the overall energy sector. This token allows holders to partake in the exponential growth that is to come in the renewable industry.\r\n4.\tStriving to solve Bitcoin\u2019s energy dependence on nonrenewable resources will allow not only Bitcoin to grow in value, but the entire cryptocurrency market.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:53:08.000Z",
