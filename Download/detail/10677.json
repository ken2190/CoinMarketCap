It uses merit-based rewards for asset pool management, rewarding positive participation.\r\n\r\nThe governance model is sustained by diverting yields back from the asset pool. This aligns interests and underpins the token\u2019s value. This model enables symmetrical token emission rates, a sustained system of rewards, and ultimately complete decentralization.\r\n\r\nPOLLEN MECHANICS\r\n\r\nPOLLEN is a decision-making protocol that responds to participants\u2019 needs and motivations while optimizing decision outcomes. This creates a sustainable, merit-based reward system by quantifying decision outcomes and rewarding users accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe POLLEN governance model diverts yield back to the community by leveraging asset pool reserves, creating an internal economy that underpins the governance tokens\u2019 value.\r\n\r\nPOLLEN has a range of voting mechanics that build on stakeholders\u2019 reputation in the system and scales user voting power through a mix of meritocratic validation of decision-making history and token stake.\r\n\r\nThose that have the power in the system will be those that have earned it through participation and the merits of their decision making.\r\n\r\nWe leverage POLLEN\u2019s meritocratic validation model to create new delegation models such as Collective Delegation, where we automatically delegate voting power to those with the best decision making performance.\r\n\r\nThe Collective Delegation model simplifies the delegation process by maintaining dynamic pools of the best performers based on voting history. This encourages passive users to delegate to the most deserving.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-27T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "5", "dateLaunched": "2020-01-11T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://pollen.id"], "technical_doc": ["https://pollen.id/#/docs"], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://github.com/PollenDeFi"], "message_board": ["https://pollen-defi.medium.com"], "chat": ["https://pollen.id/#/telegram", "https://pollen.id/#discord"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/PollenDeFi"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.99195551596571, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.37778497, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.76126544}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33076201801208, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.46531284, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.96789566}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04600186231469, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.14868791, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.17285939}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35225527622235, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.11423849, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.42822185}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08804213776288, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49769861, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.56837823}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3483481875156, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.45162233, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.05712907}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.82545567829481, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.69671449, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.87444725}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.1291243021993, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.62706083, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.22580141}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0504277483724, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.40139621, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.86305219}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:53:56.416Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
