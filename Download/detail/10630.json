{"data": {"id": 10630, "name": "Guild of Guardians", "symbol": "GOG", "slug": "guild-of-guardians", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Guild of Guardians (GOG)?\n\nGuild of Guardians is a mobile RPG where players take teams of heroes through challenging dungeons to collect resources. These resources are used to create valuable items and heroes which can be sold for real money. Players will work together to create the best squad of Guardians, contribute to their Guild, and strategise to complete the most challenging content in the game.\n\nThe game is set in a familiar, fantasy RPG world where players can play as mages, warriors, elves, orcs and more!\n\nGOG (also called Gems) is an ERC-20 token for the game used when players want to perform \u201cpremium\u201d actions that involve creating new blockchain assets. Its use cases will ber: \n\n* For minting gaming NFTs.\n* Buy assets from a primary sale.\n* Distributed back to players via an \"Active Staking\" Rewards Pool.\n* Used for Governance and Voting.\n\n## Core gameplay overview: \n\n* Players will bring a team of heroes into dungeons to fight. Team strategy here is as important as skill. Your team composition and synergies matter, as does your skill usage and ability to dodge!\n* Currently we are looking at Factional, Class, and Elemental synergies in combat. For example teams of all Horde could have their raw attack boost buffed, teams of all Fire Element could have a higher chance to inflict a damage over time effect (as an example only).\n* We are currently considering a combo system that would allow for skilled players who dodge and time attacks correctly to rack up mammoth damage numbers.\n* We want traditional RPG roles like Tank, Healer, DPS, and Support to be valuable in Guild of Guardians. Player skill in agro management, healing output, and damage output will be put to the test in our most challenging content.\n\n\n## How Many GOG Tokens Are There?\n\nThere\u2019s a hard cap of 20 million GOG tokens issued over 4 years. they will be allocated in the following areas:\n* Developers: 20%\n* Early Backers: 11%\n* Player Rewards: 35%\n* Community Rewards: Up to 28%\n* Issuing entity (Guardians Corporation): 6%\n\n\n## Who\u2019s the team behind Guild of Guardians?\nGuild of Guardians is developed by Stepico Games and published by Immutable.
