{"data": {"id": 8318, "name": "Keeper Finance", "symbol": "KFI", "slug": "keeper-finance", "category": "token", "description": "Keeper Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that is inspired by job matching protocol Keeper which is DeFi version 3.0. It is designed to be a lite version of Keeper and is a more flexible and profitable protocol.\r\n\r\nKeeper Finance offers a decentralized platform that connects developers with projects teams to execute jobs.\r\n\r\nKeeper Finance uses a unique mechanism that ensures that jobs are executed and job takers are rewarded promptly within its blockchain ecosystem. To achieve this, Keeper Finance uses a job matching concept whereby job takers called Keepers register for jobs.\r\n\r\nThese contracts (jobs) are designed to be executed by keepers and once registered can be acted upon by keepers on the Keeper Finance blockchain.\r\n\r\nHow Does Keeper Finance Work:\r\n\r\nKeeper Finance is fully decentralized and members are involved in the creation and execution of smart contracts (Jobs). All that is required for a worker is to register as a keeper and the process can only be performed by bonding KFI tokens.\r\n\r\nThe bonding process takes 24 hours after which a registered user is activated as a keeper. Once this process is completed a timestamp is registered on the Keeper Finance blockchain network.\r\n\r\nCreating jobs is flexible and easy to perform on the Keeper Finance. There are two different methods with the first via the Keeper Finance contract. This enables a job owner to register a job after which a pending governance vote is placed for the job specified by the address in the function arguments.\r\n\r\nKeeper Finance users also have a limit for a job request every 13 days when using a specific address. The second method is via governance whereby a proposal is submitted and includes the contract as a job. If governance is approve the smart contract registers as a job that can be executed by keepers.\r\n\r\nPayments are made by using the utility native token KFI which can be converted to other ERC-20 tokens on popular Dex like Uniswap.\r\n\r\nKeeperFI (KFI) Token:\r\n\r\nKeeper Finance is powered by its utility token KeeperFI (KFI). KFI is used to initiate bonding and also for the payment of rewards on the Keeper Finance platform. It is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum and offers similar attributes to Ether.", "dateAdded": "2021-01-25T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "125", "dateLaunched": "2020-11-28T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://keeper.finance/", "https://app.keeper.finance/"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.keeper.finance/"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0x4e59dfe7c5d34c498cfe18f0b6db10941d6e1a8a", "https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4e59dfe7c5d34c498cfe18f0b6db10941d6e1a8a"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/keeperfinance"], "message_board": ["https://keeper.finance/blog", "https://keeperfi.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/keeperfi"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/keeperfinance"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0x4e59dfe7c5d34c498cfe18f0b6db10941d6e1a8a", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0x4e59dfe7c5d34c498cfe18f0b6db10941d6e1a8a", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.03134700774729, "priceChangePercentage24h": 38.740772, "priceChangePercentage7d": 54.85811015}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.17988634190226, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.61080351, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.68001587}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04639854764364, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.98227793, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.98375188}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.33725852668137, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.62068265, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.54980298}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08918255131581, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.35599288, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.18401814}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3525015594285, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.77242423, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.34447687}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.58966416129965, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13094619, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.03612006}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12852564418261, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.36000344, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.48719062}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0493080904636, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.55968162, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.11264119}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:26:51.012Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
