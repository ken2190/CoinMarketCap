{"data": {"id": 10936, "name": "Swarm", "symbol": "BZZ", "slug": "swarm", "category": "token", "description": "Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes that create a decentralised storage and communication service. \r\n\r\nThe system is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Users remain sovereign owners of their personal data in alignment with fair data principles. The architecture makes the system resilient to connectivity issues, node churn, or targeted DDOS attacks, and enables a zero-downtime service.\r\n\r\n##\u00a0Swarm exists so the internet can again be decentralised. \r\n\r\nSwarm\u2019s longer term vision is to become the operating system of the re-decentralised internet. It provides a scalable and self-sustaining infrastructure for a supply-chain economy of data. \r\n\r\nThe Internet is no longer just a niche where geeks play. It has become a fundamental conduit of value creation and a huge share of overall economic activity. Yet the data economy in its current state is far from fair, the distribution of the spoils is under the control of those who control the data - mostly companies keeping the data to themselves in isolated data silos. \r\n\r\n## Key Highlights\r\n\r\n* Unstoppable features for unstoppable dApps: Privacy preservation, communication and redundancy are built in to ensure availability and continued data delivery even when individual nodes go offline. Any data, any device. On demand.\r\n\r\n* Radical data ownership and management: Data is split up into small chunks that are stored throughout the network without vulnerable central hubs. Operators cannot know what content is stored on their nodes while still being paid for storing.\r\n\r\n* Enabling zero-cost economics: No central party controls the data or can monetize it. Instead of relying on intermediaries to ensure the availability and integrity of data, all node operators participate in enabling a fair data economy.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "3", "dateLaunched": "2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 1.92, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.ethswarm.org/"], "technical_doc": ["https://www.ethswarm.org/swarm-whitepaper.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0x19062190b1925b5b6689d7073fdfc8c2976ef8cb"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/ethersphere/"], "message_board": ["https://ethswarm.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://discord.com/invite/wdghaQsGq5"], "announcement": ["https://coinlist.co/swarm"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/ethswarm"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/ethswarm"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.15277603529009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97491332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.15383074}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.34964051346751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.48864478, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65721962}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04606059556592, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.60454635, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.52026324}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35073162374456, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.29500189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.00533147}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08805508567185, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49406181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.66853882}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33953608915345, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.35932698, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.52614735}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.81208358366918, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.33740637, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.63805644}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884983830176, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.8379087, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.06023177}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05089512675303, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.36180993, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01964127}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:55:58.828Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
