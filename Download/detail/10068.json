{"data": {"id": 10068, "name": "RichieRich Coin", "symbol": "$RICH", "slug": "richierich-coin", "category": "token", "description": "RichieRich Coin is revolutionizing the DeFi space by offering the highest static rewards on the market. 15% of all transactions are automatically redistributed to our holders. This model encourages long-term holders and severely punishes day traders who get hit with the large luxury tax on their buys and sells.\r\n\r\nRichieRich Coin has been fully audited and ID verified by Dessert Swap Finance.\r\n\r\nThe presale of 100BNB was sold out in under 45 minutes. This was done by building and creating a very strong community who believed in the project prior to launch. Immediately following the presale, the token was immediately available for trade on PancakeSwap.\r\n\r\nThe founder of RichieRich Coin is an experienced mobile game developer with huge plans to create a first of its kind social NFT marketplace mobile game. The game will be powered by RichieRich Coin, and allows holders to transfer their coins into the game and purchase NFTs varying in rarity. This gives the token a real utility, and our holders are extremely excited to see the full plan of the game, which will be released within the next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the first week, RichieRich Coin hit an all time high market cap of over $10,000,000. The coin quickly amassed over 5,000 holders with over 6,000 Telegram group members, and 6,000 Twitter followers. The community is one of the strongest we've seen in a long time. Our holders are extremely loyal due to the fact that the developer team hosts live AMAs every single day on Telegram to update the holders on current marketing initiatives, current and future plans. RichieRich Coin was also listed on Coin Gecko in the first 4 days.\r\n\r\nIn 7 days, RichieRich Coin has created and executed over 20 marketing partnerships with cryptocurrency related YouTube channels (varying from 10k-300k subscribers), and over 20 top cryptocurrency Twitter influencers. This list is growing every day.\r\n\r\nRichieRich Coin is currently in the process of a complete website redesign, merchandise creation, and more. The opportunities for the token are endless.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:48:40.000Z", "watchCount": "2560", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 2e-10, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.richierichcoin.com"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x3b4443f97b37a6ef864c3f0f1632e366b4f1d20f"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/RichieRichCoin/assets"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/richierichbsc", "https://discord.gg/bTkfrrhZMM"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/richierichbsc"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/richierichbsc"]}, "volume": 0.0, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "statistics": {"price": 1.0368e-10, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.57912303, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.7604407, "priceChangePercentage7d": 9.37541937, "priceChangePercentage30d": -91.67480688, "priceChangePercentage60d": -97.19503164, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 103676.96, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 1000000000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 5711, "roi": -48.16, "low24h": 0.0, "high24h": 0.0, "low7d": 0.0, "high7d": 0.0, "low30d": 0.0, "high30d": 0.0, "low90d": 0.0, "high90d": 1e-08, "low52w": 0.0, "high52w": 1e-08, "lowAllTime": 0.0, "highAllTime": 1e-08, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 0, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -98.96, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-05-29T19:52:08.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-05-26T13:52:11.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.0, "highYesterday": 0, "openYesterday": 0.0, "closeYesterday": 0.0, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0, "volumeYesterday": 0, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x3b4443f97b37a6ef864c3f0f1632e366b4f1d20f", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x3b4443f97b37a6ef864c3f0f1632e366b4f1d20f", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.91186752921941, "priceChangePercentage24h": 34.79177057, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.71962698}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.36960577973018, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.29293143, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.80735424}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0459154546492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.8379693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.59631629}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36217183431754, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.38713656, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.0655546}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08825297302251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.52298553, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.10265883}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34948277408693, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.0744453, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.19608689}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.84617771491492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.4837804, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.38743017}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884223796591, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.22962228, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.74739738}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05344197854214, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32002778, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.49536142}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:49:30.709Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
