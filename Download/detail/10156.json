{"data": {"id": 10156, "name": "LunaDoge", "symbol": "LOGE", "slug": "lunadoge", "category": "token", "description": "What Is LunaDoge (LOGE)?\r\n\r\nLunaDoge is a DeFi meme token. A tax is applied for static rewards and automatic LP acquisition. Static rewards are proportionally shared over all LOGE holders. Automatic LP acquisition applies a tax which is added to the LP. As the LP increases, price stability increases as well.\r\n\r\nStatic rewards are used to solve problems related to impermanent loss. The reward amount is conditional upon the volume of the token being traded. This mechanism aims to alleviate some of the downward sell pressure put on the token. Furthermore, the mechanism encourages holders to hold onto their tokens to obtain rewards from every LOGE transaction. The static rewards are proportionally shared over all LOGE holders and dependent on the total tokens held.\r\n\r\nAutomatic LP acquisition is a function of the contract that is beneficial for holders as the LunaDoge contract applies a tax in LOGE to every transaction after which half is sold to BNB and then the equal share of BNB and LOGE is added to the LP. As the liquidity pool increases, the price stability increases as well. The automatic LP acquisition creates a long-term benefit for the token and solves the prior issues related to static rewards, where rewarding holders was only beneficial in the short-term. \r\n\r\nLOGE is the native utility token that is used for transactions in the LunaDoge ecosystem. A 5% tax is applied to every trade for static rewards and a 5% tax is applied to every trade for automatic LP acquisition.\r\n\r\nHow many LOGE tokens are there in circulation?\r\n\r\nLunaDoge launched its LOGE token on April 28, 2021 with 1 quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) LOGE tokens. 60% of the total supply was paired with 24 BNB and added to the PancakeSwap liquidity pool. 24% of the total supply was allocated to the team and subsequently locked for 3 to 6 months using a third-party provider. 10% of the total supply was allocated to a small whitelisted sale. The remaining 6% of the total supply is split between the marketing wallet (5%) and airdrop wallet (1%).\r\n\r\nAs per May 26, 2021, 10.6 trillion LOGE (1.06% of the total supply) have been burned at https://bscscan.com/token/0xb99172949554e6c10c28c880ec0306d2a9d5c753?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead. This results in a circulating supply of 989.4 trillion LOGE.\r\n\r\nWho are the founders of LunaDoge?\r\n\r\nLunaDoge has been created by a group of cryptocurrency investors from Western Europe who have been in this space since 2016. They have been in a Discord channel building behind the scenes since March 2021 to launch a meme token with a long-term vision, as seen by the two mechanisms in the contract. As per May 26, 2021 a fully functioning DAO has been developed (https://snapshot.org/#/lunadoge.eth), resulting in a community-driven approach for the future where holders are able to propose certain decisions. The developers have experience in Solidity and SQL.\r\n\r\nWhere can I buy LunaDoge (LOGE)?\r\n\r\nLOGE is available for trading on PancakeSwap with a LOGE-BNB pair currently available for trading.
