{"data": {"id": 693, "name": "Verge", "symbol": "XVG", "slug": "verge", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Verge (XVG)?\n\nVerge is a privacy-focused [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) and [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) that seeks to offer a fast, efficient, decentralized payments network that improves upon the original [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) blockchain. It includes additional privacy features including integrating the anonymity network Tor into its wallet, called vergePay, and providing the option of sending transactions to stealth addresses.\n\nThe project describes itself as community-driven, relying on volunteers and priding itself on being open source.\n\nVerge was first [launched](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=817937.0) in October 2014 as DogeCoinDark, a fork of [Peercoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/peercoin/) (PPC). In February 2016, it was [renamed](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1365894.0) Verge in order to [rebrand](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/verge-currencies-xvg-new-branding-7b8c23a4e7e4) for easier mass-market adoption and to distinguish itself from [Dogecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/) (DOGE), with which it has no direct connection. The project is now based on the Bitcoin source code.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Verge?\n\nVerge was launched in 2016 by Justin Valo, also known as \"Justin Vendetta\" or \"Sunerok,\" a developer with over 20 years of [experience](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/meet-the-team-behind-verge-currency-cc61d6057b36) in network security and nearly a decade in blockchain technology. He first developed the cryptocurrency as a fun passion project to empower individuals around the world with a greater sense of privacy.\n\nValo has [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ8iUOVgqsk) that he has been programming since the age of 8 and became involved in network administration after high school, working for a Fortune 500 company. After a few years, he decided to start his own network security company.\n\nValo first became interested in Bitcoin in 2011, later getting [involved](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/the-birth-of-verge-currency-3f729cc6b64c) with Dogecoin after its late 2013 launch. He began working on Verge because he [believed](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/verge-currency-and-the-vergefam-community-cff57401955d) that none of the altcoins being developed at the time were adequately functional as digital currencies and that the only other serious privacy coin projects --- [Bytecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bytecoin-bcn/) (BCN) and [Monero](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero) (XMR) --- were not sufficient.\n\nIn 2017, Valo was [appointed](https://www.facebook.com/tokenpay/posts/advisor-lead-developer-of-verge-sunerok-joined-tokenpays-advisory-boardlearn-mor/148499659208889/) to the advisory board of [TokenPay](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tokenpay/) (TPAY), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\n## What Makes Verge Unique?\n\nAccording to its \"blackpaper,\" Verge was [created](https://vergecurrency.com/static/blackpaper/verge-blackpaper-v5.0.pdf) as a way to fulfill Bitcoin founder [Satoshi Nakamoto's](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto) vision of a decentralized, trustless electronic payment system while also providing more privacy than is available with Bitcoin.\n\nIn order to accomplish this goal, Verge relies on a series of key privacy features. It automatically routes all traffic to and from its vergePay wallet through the Tor network, anonymizing the traffic and masking IP addresses. It also offers dual-key stealth addressing, through which senders can create one-time wallet addresses on behalf of recipients to help protect the recipients' privacy, as well as using [atomic swaps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/atomic-swap) to power trustless [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) cross-blockchain transactions.\n\nVerge seeks mainstream adoption, and as such, the Verge Core team pursues strategic partnerships to increase its awareness and use. It [sponsors](https://vergecurrency.com/fueled-by-verge/) professional athletes and has partnered with platforms such as payments and rewards ecosystem [MobiePay](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/verge-currency-and-mobiepay-team-up-8f58f1d33853), crypto payments platform and ATM provider [MeconCash](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/verge-meconcash-press-release-cc17678d68cd), and blockchain-based online gambling platform [Crazy8Token](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/crazy-8-welcomes-verge-currency-to-the-59-billion-dollar-gambling-industy-1065356c2540), among others.\n\nThe Verge Core team often [relies on](https://medium.com/@sashakolupaev/atomic-announcement-crowdfunding-campaign-3173d1a8473d) crowdfunding and community support to be able to scale, market and pursue partnerships. In April 2018, the project [raised](https://medium.com/vergecurrency/verge-from-seed-to-revolution-fc3833333ba5) 75 million XVG ([approximately](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/verge/historical-data/?start=20180401&end=20180429) $7 million at the time) to cover the costs of integrating with a major payments processor.\n\n## Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Monero](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero), the largest privacy coin by market capitalization.\n\nLearn about [Zcash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash), another privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n\nWant to know even more about privacy? Read an [in-depth exploration](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/is-cryptocurrency-anonymous) of anonymity within crypto on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on the latest in crypto privacy and security with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n#### How Many Verge (XVG) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total maximum supply of Verge is capped at 16.5 billion XVG. According to Verge, the supply cap is [intentionally](https://vergecurrency.com/faq/) high as a way to ensure that the value of each individual token remains low, allowing users to avoid fractional payments. It also makes it more difficult for any one individual to take control of a large number of XVG in order to manipulate markets.\n\nThe cryptocurrency did not have an [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico), nor was there any premining of tokens. As such, the Verge development team has said it does not hold a significant amount of XVG. Rather, all currently circulating XVG was introduced through the Verge blockchain's [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) mining process, which is multialgorithmic and supports Scrypt, X17, Lyra2rev2, Myr-groestl and Blake2s.\n\nVerge undergoes a periodic halving event that reduces the amount of XVG miners receive as a block reward by 50%. Under the current emission [schedule](https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge), rewards are halved every 500,000 blocks.\n\n## How Is the Verge Network Secured?\n\nThe Verge network is secured through a proof-of-work [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm similar to that of Bitcoin, on which Verge's code is based. At least 51% of all full nodes in the network must agree that a transaction is valid in order for it to be added to the blockchain, and new blocks are created through the mining process, in which users compete among one another to solve complex, energy-intensive problems. However, unlike Bitcoin, Verge supports five different mining algorithms. According to the development team, this makes the network more secure, as more people are able to participate in the mining process.\n\nIn April 2018, Verge [suffered](https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/981578693062610950) an attack on its network that used an exploit related to the Scrypt mining algorithm to instamine a [reported](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.0) 20 million XVG. In response, the project initiated a hard fork to patch the issue. While it was widely referred to as a [51% attack](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack), founder and lead developer Valo [denied](https://twitter.com/justinvendetta/status/1243002670505496576) this, saying it was actually a timewarp attack, which involves manipulating block timestamps in order to reduce mining difficulty.\n\n## Where Can You Buy Verge (XVG)?\n\nXVG is available to purchase on many exchanges including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [HitBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hitbtc/), [Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/). It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), and the [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin)  [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT)\n\nAre you interested in buying XVG or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin)?
