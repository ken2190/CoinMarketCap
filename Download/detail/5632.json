{"data": {"id": 5632, "name": "Arweave", "symbol": "AR", "slug": "arweave", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Arweave (AR)?\n\nArweave is a decentralized [storage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/storage-decentralized) network that seeks to offer a platform for the indefinite storage of data. [Describing](https://www.arweave.org/#arweave-intro) itself as \"a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets,\" the network primarily hosts \"the permaweb\" \u2014 a permanent, decentralized web with a number of community-driven applications and platforms.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Arweave](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/profit-sharing-communities-a-deep-dive-by-arweave).\n\nThe Arweave network uses a native [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), AR, to pay \"miners\" to indefinitely store the network's information.\n\nThe project was first [announced](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2066098) as Archain in August 2017, later [rebranding](https://arweave.medium.com/archain-now-known-as-arweave-432f0708eed0) to Arweave in February 2018 and officially [launching](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-network-launch-report-b7e7ffac0f75) in June 2018.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Arweave?\n\nArweave was founded by Sam Williams and William Jones, two Ph.D. candidates at the University of Kent. Williams came to the project with experience in decentralized and distributed systems, having developed an operating system called HydrOS as a part of his studies, while Jones' focus was on graph theory and neural networking. While Williams dropped out of graduate school to focus on the company, Jones left the project early on in mid-2018 and completed his Ph.D.\n\nAccording to Williams, he came up with the idea while [walking](https://cryptosrus.com/interview-with-ceo-sam-williams-and-cto-will-jones-of-archain/) up a mountain in Scotland, later bringing the concept to Jones, with whom he developed the technical details. After launching Arweave, Williams was later named an advisor to Minespider, a company providing [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based supply chain tracking for the raw materials industry, and he has served as a mentor for the Techstars accelerator program.\n\nAlthough Arweave was founded with centralized leadership, it [launched](https://arweave.medium.com/the-arca-dao-is-launched-71d59fd79f7) a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) in January 2020 comprised of core community members to further the development and expansion of the network and its ecosystem.\n\n\n#### What Makes Arweave Unique?\n\nAccording to its yellow paper, Arweave [seeks](https://www.arweave.org/yellow-paper.pdf) to ensure the \"collective ability to store and share information between individuals and across time to new generations.\" In order to accomplish this goal, its flagship permaweb is built on top of Arweave's \"blockweave,\" a variation of blockchain technology in which each block is linked to both the one immediately prior and also a random earlier one. Arweave says this incentivizes miners to store more data because they need to be able to access random previous blocks to add new ones and receive rewards.\n\nArweave is focused on building a sustainable ecosystem around the network. In June 2020, it [unveiled](https://arweave.medium.com/profit-sharing-tokens-a-new-incentivization-mechanism-for-an-open-web-1f2532411d6e) \"profit sharing tokens,\" which allow developers to receive dividends when network transaction fees are generated from their application, and it [hosts](https://arweave.medium.com/launching-the-first-open-web-incubator-100-000-available-for-investment-in-profit-sharing-tokens-644a5a22ee25) incubators to support the building of permaweb-based apps. The project also works with startups through its \"Boost\" program, [offering](https://arweave.medium.com/announcing-arweave-boost-support-to-help-your-startup-thrive-b4750410e885) free storage and access to the Arweave team and industry investors.\n\nIn March 2020, Arweave [announced](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-announces-new-funding-from-andreessen-horowitz-usv-and-coinbase-ventures-30a1fde3d8c5) that it had received $8.3 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Coinbase Ventures. This followed an earlier November 2019 [investment](https://arweave.medium.com/welcoming-a16z-crypto-union-square-ventures-and-multicoin-capital-to-the-arweave-community-56ccc9f98ff3) also from Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, as well as Multicoin Capital.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Filecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/), a distributed storage network from the creators of the InterPlanetary File System.\n\nLearn about [Siacoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/siacoin/), the native cryptocurrency of the Sia distributed cloud storage network.\n\nWant to know more about decentralized storage? [Read more about](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/5-things-that-decentralized-storage-aims-to-fix) what it seeks to achieve on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nKeep up with the latest in technological innovations offered by blockchain with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Arweave (AR) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAccording to its yellow paper, Arweave has a maximum token supply of 66 million AR. 55 million AR was minted when the blockweave's genesis block was created in June 2018, and an additional 11 million will be gradually introduced as block rewards.\n\nArweave held a token pre-sale event in August 2017 in which 10.8% of the initially generated token supply was sold, and two public sales were [completed](https://arweave.medium.com/announcing-the-arweave-community-token-sale-part-two-28f2b37c73d6) in May 2018 and June 2018 in which 7.1% and 1.1% of the supply was sold, respectively. The company [allocated](https://icoanalytics.medium.com/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%80-ico-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B0-arweave-5f4a1a42d333) an additional 19.5% for a private sale, 2.9% for project advisors, 13% for the team (subject to a five-year lock-up with 20% released per year), 19.1% for ecosystem development, and 26.5% for future project use (subject to a five-year lock-up with 20% released per year).\n\n\n### How Is the Arweave Network Secured?\n\nThe Arweave network is built on a modified version of blockchain technology it calls \"blockweave,\" which uses a \"proof-of-access\" [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm \u2014 a modified version of [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake). With PoA, each new block is not only linked to the one immediately prior to it but to a random previous block as well, and both blocks are hashed to generate the new one. Miners are not required to store an entire blockchain, but they are incentivized to store more information to prove they can access the old blocks that are required to mine a new one.\n\nThe mining protocol used by Arweave, RandomX, was successfully [audited](https://ostif.org/four-audits-of-randomx-for-monero-and-arweave-have-been-completed-results/) by four cybersecurity firms \u2014 Trail of Bits, Kudelski Security, X41 D-Sec and QuarksLab \u2014 in August 2019. The project plans to utilize a new mining algorithm starting in early 2021 known as SPoRA, which it [said](https://twitter.com/ArweaveTeam/status/1338600305643167745) in December 2020 had been audited by NCC Group.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Arweave (AR)?\n\nAR can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), and [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/), among others. It can be traded against the stablecoin Tether ([USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)) as well as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH).\n\nAre you interested in buying AR or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin)?
