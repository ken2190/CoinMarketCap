{"data": {"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "symbol": "NEO", "slug": "neo", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Neo (NEO)?\n\n** **\n\nNeo bills itself as a \u201crapidly growing and developing\u201d ecosystem that has the goal of becoming the foundation for the next generation of the internet \u2014 a new economy where digitized payments, identities and assets come together.\n\n \n\nInitially known as Antshares, this project was believed to be China\u2019s first-ever public blockchain when it was launched in February 2014. The open-source platform subsequently rebranded to Neo three years later.\n\n \n\nAs well as creating a worldwide community of developers who create new infrastructure for the network and lower barriers to entry, the team behind this project operate an EcoBoost initiative that\u2019s designed to encourage people to build decentralized apps and smart contracts on its blockchain.\n\n \n\nIt\u2019s often been likened to the Chinese version of the Ethereum network.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Neo?\n\n** **\n\nThe co-founders of Neo, and its predecessor Antshares, are Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. Both serve as chairmen of the Neo Foundation, which aims to promote the blockchain\u2019s adoption.\n\n \n\nDa Hongfei has said that, although the internet is a great invention, it has many flaws \u2014 and this means that everyday consumers don\u2019t always have control over their own data. The entrepreneur believes blockchain applications will eventually go mainstream.\n\n \n\nErik Zhang was the author of the Delegated [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) algorithm, which aims to deter untrustworthy participants from taking part in the blockchain\u2019s operation. This technology went on to be used in the Neo blockchain. He also served as the core developer for this network, and is playing an instrumental role in the development of Neo 3.0, the next iteration of the project\u2019s infrastructure.\n\n\n## What Makes Neo Unique?\n\n** **\n\nOne of the unique selling points of the Neo blockchain concerns its continuous development, which helps ensure that it is futureproof and able to cope with sudden increases in demand. As mentioned earlier, the project has developed Neo 3.0 \u2014 enhancing network security and allowing a greater number of transactions per second to be processed.\n\n \n\nUnlike many other blockchains, this network also has two native tokens: NEO and GAS. While NEO serves as an investment token and allows people to participate in votes concerning improvements to the blockchain, GAS is used to pay fees for the transactions that are being completed on the network.\n\n \n\nFew other blockchain projects also run a development fund to the extent that Neo does. EcoBoost launched back in 2019, and it was billed as an initiative that provides \u201cfull life-cycle support for high-potential projects\u201d \u2014 including grants, technical support and promotion on social media.\n\n \n\n**Related Pages**:                                                  \n\n \n\n[Find out more about GAS, the second native token to Neo](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gas/)\n\n \n\n[How does Neo compare with Ethereum?](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)\n\n \n\n[Explore our comprehensive crypto how-to guides](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/how-to-guides)\n\n \n\n[What\u2019s going on in the crypto industry? Find out in our blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n\n### How Many Neo (NEO) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\n** **\n\nAt the time of writing, there are 70.5 million NEO in circulation \u2014 and a total supply of 100 million. NEO tokens aren\u2019t mined, and indeed, all 100 million of them were generated when the blockchain launched.\n\n \n\nThese tokens were distributed on a 50/50 basis \u2014 with half going to participants in a token sale, and the other half being split among developers and the NEO Council. At the time, it was confirmed that these funds would be used to invest in other blockchain protocol that the organization supports.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, GAS is generated every 20 seconds or so, whenever a new block is created. The number of tokens created gradually reduces every year, and it\u2019s estimated that it\u2019ll take 22 years for the total supply of 100 million to enter circulation.\n\n\n### How Is the Neo Network Secured?\n\n** **\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Neo uses Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and it\u2019s estimated that the blockchain is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second.\n\n \n\nAccording to Neo, the dBFT mechanism has been inspired by the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm.\n\n \n\nThere are a couple of similarities with delegated proof-of-stake, given how both consensus mechanisms allow token holders to vote for the delegates who will process transactions.\n\n \n\nThrough dBFT, blocks are added to a blockchain as long as at least two-thirds of delegates reach consensus \u2014 and it\u2019s hoped that this helps prevent bad actors from undermining the smooth running of the network.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Neo (NEO)?\n\n** **\n\nNEO can be purchased on a number of exchanges \u2014 most people [buy NEO](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-NEO) on Binance, Poloniex and HitBTC. But it isn\u2019t available universally and isn\u2019t supported by some platforms, such as Coinbase.\n\n \n\nMany exchanges offer trading pairs that link NEO with Bitcoin.[ Find out more about
