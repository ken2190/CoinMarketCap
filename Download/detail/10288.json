Sadly it is now more common than ever that fraudulent developers are launching the latter with the intention of scamming or abandoning projects for financial gain at the cost of others. Realistically these types of \"moonshot\"projects will continue to become more and more popular driven by the viral success of projects such as Safemoon & Elongate. The Healing Potion project is has been created to offer tools to assist the \"Moonshot\" community identify the legitimate projects from the fraudulent. \r\nWhy Healing Potion? Because its time to regen those losses!\r\nLike many others in the moonshot cryptocurrency community space our team have been victim to scams, honeypots, rug pulls and developers abandoning projects. We also found that projects that were mildly successful lacked experienced commercial leadership, generally resulting in a decline in community support and overall failure of the project. These types of results were unsatisfactory for investors and detrimental to the cryptocurrency community as a whole. The common perspective of the Binance Smart Chain is starting to build a negative reputation due to the number of fraudulent projects and developers listing projects on this network.\r\n\r\nWe decided that something needed to be done. \r\nThe culture and community attached to the Binance Smart Chain network deserved a legitimate, driven, structured project for people to take part in and build wealth and security as a community. A unified project that can;\r\nEstablish a fun Fantasy NFT powered community. Proceeds donated to arthouses or charities.\r\nSeek to provide verified insight and information about upcoming \"Moonshot\" projects. What projects are legitimate and what are scams as reported by the community.\r\nEstablish an user friendly research platform via charting tools \"Brewlab\"\r\nProvide a platform for legitimate developers to reach their target audience. \r\nSeek to educate new individuals entering the DEFI \"Moonshot\" space.\r\nOffer a one stop shop platform world first multidex which will combine currency DEX and a NFT marketplace by the name of the \"Cauldon.\"\r\nLaunch a funding platform for production houses. The world needs as much creativity as possible!\r\nThe team behind Healing Potion project have real world commercial and entrepreneurial experience to guide this project and community in the successful direction it deserves. The development team will not renounce the project therefore supporting the community the development and future of the Healing Potion project.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-05T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:49:10.000Z", "watchCount": "2699", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.healingpot.info", "https://www.brewlabs.tools"], "technical_doc": ["https://healing-potion.gitbook.io/healing-potion-whitepaper/"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xc974be717f52dcc701fe50fad36d163b1e9a3a82"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/healingpot", "https://discord.gg/sbWeXZRyMP"], "announcement": ["https://t.me/healingpotannounce"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/Healingpottoken"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/FinancePotion"]}, "volume": 6070.48595284, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.967, "statistics": {"price": 2.2022e-09, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.98950827, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.08070808, "priceChangePercentage7d": 4.33196646, "priceChangePercentage30d": 36.02459683, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 2202197.42, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 1000000000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4259, "low24h": 0.0, "high24h": 0.0, "low7d": 0.0, "high7d": 0.0, "low30d": 0.0, "high30d": 1e-08, "low90d": 0.0, "high90d": 1e-08, "low52w": 0.0, "high52w": 1e-08, "lowAllTime": 0.0, "highAllTime": 1e-08, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 0, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -77.98, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-05T05:28:03.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-05T05:55:03.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.0, "highYesterday": 0, "openYesterday": 0.0, "closeYesterday": 0.0, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0, "volumeYesterday": 9082.78, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xc974be717f52dcc701fe50fad36d163b1e9a3a82", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xc974be717f52dcc701fe50fad36d163b1e9a3a82", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.95012133608962, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.14534198, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.67063994}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.35385261564175, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.42971627, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.53591158}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04597065485341, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.9713895, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.70390874}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08818568964251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.68090104, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.9905728}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.85315809919322, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.59097836, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50061523}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884704433161, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.2284312, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.45313593}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:51:08.147Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "14", "credit_count": 0}}
