If this society cannot take care of its children, then it is set to continuously fail, over and over.\n\nThe second one is our business implementation; \n\nThere is a plague of non ethical projects and bad actors who seek no business implementation, never the less bring value to humanity.  Popular tokens that are devised as a pyramid scheme by these non ethical developers, not only endanger the image of our revolutionary technology, but retrace its mass adoption, leaving many users destroyed when they pay the imminent bill. It is not \u201cif\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d.  \n\nIn this era of revolutionary block chain technology, a one-of-a-kind opportunity arises for regular humans to interact in new economic dynamics, cooperating in new financial models that are more democratic, fast, cooperative and accessible.\n\nThe key element of our proposal is to encourage a whole new generation of ethical and socially responsible projects like ours to solve in a definite way the most overwhelming problems we face as a society.
