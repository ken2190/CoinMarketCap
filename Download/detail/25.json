Goldcoin like Bitcoin has no single company or individual owner. It is decentralized and open source and belongs to the world. Since its creation, several cryptocurrency enthusiasts and programmers who believe in promoting economic freedom have got involved in its development. Thanks to these principles and a focus on game-changing usability features, like two-minute confirmation speeds and instant 0-Conf transactions, GoldCoin is fundamentally changing how cryptocurrency and economies operate.\n\nGoldCoin capitalizes on the lessons taught by other cryptocurrencies, and it\u2019s likely to inspire new developments in the days and years to come. What really makes it stand out, however, is its feature-focused development cycle. GoldCoin leverages the power of on-chain scaling and large 2MB blocks to grow with demand without straying from Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s innovative vision. As a multi-pool resistant value store that retargets difficulty in each block. It\u2019s a proven system where awards are based on math alone. Thanks to its SegWit-free design, the ledger is truly verifiable and safe. Even better, it\u2019s powered by an innovative 51 percent defense algorithm and devoted community working together.\n\n# Features of Goldcoin GLC\nThe Goldcoin blockchain runs on the proof of work (POW) consensus which is an algorithm used by the most popular cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin\nTill today GLC has gone through several advancements in technology since then which are far more advanced than Bitcoin such as:\n\n* 2 Min block interval (Bitcoin has 10 min block interval)\n* 32 MB block size (Bitcoin has 2 MB block size)\n* On-chain scaling\n* Network capacity is 1120 TPS (transactions per second) Bitcoin is 7 TPS\n* Instant transactions\n* 51% Defense System https://www.goldcoinweb.com/cherry-services/51-defense-system/ Meaning of 51% attack: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp\n\n## Where to Buy\nGoldcoin can be bought and traded on the following exchanges.
