{"data": {"id": 1816, "name": "Civic", "symbol": "CVC", "slug": "civic", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Civic (CVC)?\n\nCivic is a [blockchain-based](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) identity management solution that gives individuals and businesses the tools they need to control and protect personal identity information. \n\nThe platform is designed to change the way we think about identity verification by giving users more control over their personal data, while allowing them to access a wide range of services without needing to fork over excessive amounts of personal information.\n\nCivic's identity verification solution uses distributed ledger technology to authorize identity usage in real time, and is used to sparingly share information with Civic partners after authorization by the user. \n\n \\\nUnlike some other identity management services, Civic users store all their sensitive data on their mobile device. Users are able to authorize the sharing of specific personal data by providing a biometric signature through the Civic app. \n\nThe Civic ecosystem is enabled by a unique utility token known as the Civic token (CVC), which is used for the settlement of identity-related transactions between Civic participants \u2014 such as between a customer and service provider.\n\nUsers can earn CVC tokens for completing a variety of tasks, such as signing up for a service through the platform or introducing new users, while validators can earn CVCs for validating documents for service providers.\n\nCivic was launched in 2018, following a sell-out initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) the year prior.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Civic?\n\nCivic was co-founded in 2015 by Vinny Lingham and Jonathan Smith.\n\nVinny Lingham is a serial entrepreneur who appeared on Shark Tank South Africa in 2016, and has co-founded several prominent firms, including a South Africa-based investment fund known as Newtown Partners and Gyft \u2014 a Google ventures-backed digital card platform. Lingham is Civic\u2019s CEO. \n\nJonathan Smith is the current CTO of the platform and has more than 15 years of experience in the banking industry. Prior to his role at Civic, Smith held various managerial roles at prominent firms, including Deloitte MCS Limited and HSH Nordbank, and was the global head of Platforms at Genpact Headstrong Capital Markets.\n\nIn addition to the founders, the Civic team includes a host of highly successful individuals, including COO Chris Hart, who has two decades of experience in senior finance, and previously held the role of CFO at Guidebook and Nextag. \n\nThe official Civic [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%227595700%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&page=2) currently lists 38 employees, many of which are based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\n#### What Makes Civic Unique?\n\nCivic is built to make it easy for users to verify their identity with service providers, while still retaining full control over their personal information. \n\nIt allows businesses to onboard users faster using its AI-powered verification system, which when combined with human review helps businesses cut down on fraud and stay compliant with AML regulations and OFAC rules.\n\nAs of December 2020, Civic has two main products: the Civic wallet and Health Key. \n\nThe Civic wallet is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that can be used to store a handful of popular cryptocurrencies, including [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), and [USD Coin (USDC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/). The app doubles as a digital identity management solution, and benefits from a $1 million Bitcoin insurance plan provided by Coincover. \n\nHealth Key is Civic\u2019s newest product. This is an app that allows employers to securely verify the health status of employees, to ensure they are healthy enough to return to the workplace after an infection with COVID19 \u2014 such as if they test positive for antibodies or have been vaccinated. This is achieved without compromising the privacy of the employee. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Renme (REM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/remme/) \u2014 an ecosystem of identity management products.\n\nTake a look at [ShareRing (SHR)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sharetoken/) \u2014 a decentralized sharing economy with a self-sovereign identity module.\n\nLearn more about digital identity with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/digital-identity)<sup>.</sup>\n\nStay on top of the market with the latest news, updates, and insights with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Civic (CVC) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of late December 2020, there are exactly 670 million CVC tokens in circulation, representing 67% of the maximum 1 billion CVC total supply. The current circulating supply can be found in the right data panel.\n\nAs per the Civic token sale [website](https://tokensale.civic.com/), a total of 1 billion CVC were minted, of which 33% were sold in the token sale; 33% is retained by Civic; 33% is allocated for incentives and rewards; and the remaining 1% was used to cover token sale costs.\n\nAs of December 2020, the 330 million tokens allocated to Civic remains untouched. It is currently being held in a multi-signature Ethereum wallet, which can be tracked [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x41e5560054824ea6b0732e656e3ad64e20e94e45#balances). \n\n\n### How Is the Civic Network Secured?\n\nAs an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, CVC is backed by the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 which is widely regarded to be of the most decentralized and secure [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) networks in current usage. \n\nOver time, [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) will gradually transition to [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POS) with the roll-out of [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0). Once complete, the CVC token and associated transactions will be secured by a network of validator nodes.\n\nDigital identities secured through the Civic app are protected by the user\u2019s own device, which customers use to control access to their data. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Civic (CVC)?\n\nThe CVC token is highly liquid and can be traded on dozens of exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/). It is most commonly traded against [Tether (USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)), the Korean won (KRW) and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nFor a full list of exchanges, check the market pairs section.
