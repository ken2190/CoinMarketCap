The idea is to share cats with every human being on earth. Share cuteness, caring and fun, no private equity, no crowdfunding. Team members are also developing a quantum-level(Superluminal) mobile quotation app around the clock. The total amount of 999 million tokens will also be destroyed by black holes every quarter until 99% of the quantity is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe GingerCat community issued token GCAT will create a total supply of nine digits with the meaning \u201cA cat has nine lives\u201d (of course, cats are also easily injured in real life). After a heated discussion, it was agreed to lock the final circulating supply to 9,999,999, and the GingerCat token was officially born!\r\n\r\nTokenomics:\r\nTotal Supply: 999,999,999\r\nCirculating Supply: 9,999,999\r\n-Team\uff1a1,000,000\r\n-Airdrop\uff1a500,000\r\n-Development\uff1a500,000\r\n-Liquidity\uff1a7,999,999\r\n\r\nCoin Burn: The GCAT burning events are scheduled to take place every quarter until 990,000,000 GCAT are finally destroyed, which represents 99% of the total GCAT ever issued (999,999,999 GCAT).\r\n\r\nAs soon as a quarterly Coin Burn takes place, Team makes an official announcement that specifies the amount of GCAT coins that were burned.
