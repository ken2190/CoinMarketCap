Ask anyone who has ever bought a home. Sold a home, or even tried to flip a house as an investor. The selling  part of this process alone will age you a few years. Then there comes the realtor fees. That might not be so bad as you want someone with experience selling your home or helping you find your dream home. Every day you have to make sure that your home is 100% clean 100% of the time as you never know when someone wants to come see your home. Then comes escrow fee, inspection fees, cost for repair, professional pictures, staging, closing costs from the mortgage company, moving trucks. Then there are the problems of choosing a closing date that matches with the person that is trying to close on their house. Do you feel stressed yet? Oh, then there is the closing date from the people that are buying from you. Ok, we will stop there. XRE Global has the solutions and we are excited to bring these solutions with XRE Global to you", "dateAdded": "2021-05-29T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:48:34.000Z", "watchCount": "656", "dateLaunched": "2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://xreglobal.com"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://tronscan.org/#/token/1003593"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/xreglobal"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/xreglobal / https://Twitter.com/xrefoundation / https://Facebook.com/xreglobal"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/xrefoundation"]}, "volume": 13175.99561169, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 17.3335, "statistics": {"price": 6.405930993e-05, "priceChangePercentage1h": -0.12474867, "priceChangePercentage24h": -14.83257925, "priceChangePercentage7d": -12.05030848, "priceChangePercentage30d": -17.77403675, "priceChangePercentage60d": -77.54894577, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 3523262.05, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 55000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4057, "low24h": 6.333e-05, "high24h": 8.487e-05, "low7d": 6.333e-05, "high7d": 0.00013994, "low30d": 3.653e-05, "high30d": 0.00013994, "low90d": 1e-08, "high90d": 0.00030334, "low52w": 1e-08, "high52w": 0.00030334, "lowAllTime": 1e-08, "highAllTime": 0.00030334, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 640493.1, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -78.88, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-14T09:43:23.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-01T10:14:11.000Z", "lowYesterday": 6.333e-05, "highYesterday": 8.543e-05, "openYesterday": 8.387e-05, "closeYesterday": 7.123e-05, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -15.07, "volumeYesterday": 10973.9, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1958, "contractAddress": "1003593", "contractPlatform": "Tron", "contractPlatformId": 2, "contractChainId": -1, "contractRpcUrl": [], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://tronscan.org/#/address/1003593", "contractDecimals": 6, "platformCryptoId": 1958}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.91186752921941, "priceChangePercentage24h": 34.79177057, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.71962698}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.36960577973018, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.29293143, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.80735424}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0459154546492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.8379693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.59631629}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36217183431754, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.38713656, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.0655546}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08825297302251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.52298553, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.10265883}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34948277408693, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.0744453, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.19608689}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.84617771491492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.4837804, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.38743017}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884223796591, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.22962228, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.74739738}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05344197854214, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32002778, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.49536142}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9146, "name": "Tronlink", "url": "https://www.tronlink.org/", "chains": "TRON", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "default.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:50:10.349Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
