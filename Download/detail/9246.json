{"data": {"id": 9246, "name": "BitMinutes", "symbol": "BMT", "slug": "bitminutes", "category": "coin", "description": "BitMinutes is a blockchain-based token that provides the FinTech marketplace a number of enhancements that fill critical gaps. \r\nFirst, through its proprietary patent-pending Atomic Swap software, any wallet base built with it can offer fiat and crypto-currency trading within the wallet. No need to extract assets to trade on an exchange to rebalance, add to or subtract from your portfolio. \r\nSecond, through the wholly owned Trusted Agent Network, BitMinutes solves the \u201clast mile\u201d problem of cash in/cash out that bedevils most FinTech solutions. Everyday citizens of developing countries can add cash through their local agent (often a local retailer), buy various currencies, send currencies free to other wallets anywhere in the world, and convert their assets back into cash through their local agent. \r\nThird, the BitMinute is tied to a real-world asset, the prepaid phone minute. It is a universal prepaid minute that can be converted to airtime on any mobile phone.\r\nFourth, through its parent company UberFi, the BitMinute provides the foundation for a DeFi liquidity pool that can kickstart the microlending program within any country we operate.\r\nThe BitMinute ecosystem is live in both Nigeria, where an agent network is growing under the BitMinutes brand, and in Kenya, where it provides the technological backbone for the Akoin project that has launched in Mwale City. BitMinutes wallet and exchange technology is also now live in Guatemala, where our joint venture partner Genesis plans to build a micro-loan program with it.\r\nThe BitMinute program is focused on expanding financial inclusion throughout the developing world using this technology. Our mission is to eliminate the expensive middlemen who take a cut in every transaction or charges exorbitant rates on loans to consumers and small businesspeople.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "59", "dateLaunched": "2018-04-29T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://bitminutes.com/", "https://tanagent.com"], "technical_doc": ["https://bitminutes.com/dox/BitMinutes_WhitePaper_v200201.pdf"], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/@bitminutes"], "chat": ["https://t.me/Bitminuteschat"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/bitminutes"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.39573307597338, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.99695168, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.65196276}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.13951826462414, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.41720606, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.23403521}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04642130446666, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47479612, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76378252}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34543127132665, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.10634214, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.07975349}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08809375205785, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47012283, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.20479819}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3365804189963, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.72571723, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.81210172}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.61551425760311, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.84200543, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.02118715}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12756201108951, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.48873139, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44700682}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04698230570444, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32158169, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.92562492}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:33:27.679Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
