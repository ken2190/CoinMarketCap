The company says that thousands of backers have signed up to become active stakeholders in their favorite artists through the platform.\n\nThe platform has run more than 150 campaigns, generating millions of streams. Artist collaborations include Danny Saucedo, Sabina Ddumba, Kid Travis and King Charles.
