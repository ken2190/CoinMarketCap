{"data": {"id": 9313, "name": "Autosteak Finance", "symbol": "STEAK", "slug": "autosteak-finance", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is AutoSteak?\r\n\r\nAutoSteak is a gaming platform built with the community in mind. By leveraging automatic, in-wallet staking and deflationary protocols, AutoSteak is able to reward the community of token holders and incentivize holding by applying a transaction fee to every STEAK transaction on the Binance Smart Chain and the AutoSteak Gaming Platform. A portion of this fee is awarded proportionally to all STEAK holders, and the other portion is burned forever, permanently reducing the total supply. AutoSteak incentivizes transactions on the network by providing community members the opportunity to earn and multiply their STEAK through playing various games of chance and skill in the AutoSteak gaming ecosystem. \r\n\r\nSTEAK is the native utility token that is used for:\r\n\r\n* Participating in AutoSteak\u2019s gaming platform\r\n* Rewarding community members for participation and holding\r\n* Governance votes to determine protocol changes and games to be implemented into the gaming ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Many STEAK Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nAutoSteak launched on the Binance Smart Chain mainnet on March 23, 2021 with 100 million STEAK tokens created at genesis. Due to the deflationary nature of AutoSteak, a portion of every transaction is burned forever. In addition to the burn fee, there exists an additional fee on every transaction which is then distributed proportionally as a reward for holding to all STEAK holders. This reward is what makes AutoSteak a truly automatic staking protocol. The percentage of STEAK burned and rewarded every transaction will be subject to change through community governance.\r\n\r\n### Where Can I Buy AutoSteak (STEAK)?\r\n\r\nSTEAK is available for trading on Pancakeswap against BNB with other exchanges coming soon. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What Makes AutoSteak Unique?\r\n\r\nAutoSteak is the first gaming platform that aims to give back to token holders with as little effort from their side as possible. Without moving their STEAK tokens out of their wallet, they are able to watch their balance grow. No more transaction fees for removing or providing their tokens to a platform. The idea of the house always winning is what AutoSteak aims to destroy. The community members always win. Regardless of what happens with the outcome of a game on the AutoSteak platform, the token holders benefit no matter what.\r\n\r\nThrough AutoSteak\u2019s governance protocols, the community has the ultimate deciding power in the direction of the project. By giving the community members a platform to suggest and vote on new implementations of games and protocol changes, AutoSteak becomes a self governing and autonomous organization.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "65", "dateLaunched": "2021-03-23T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://autosteak.finance/"], "technical_doc": ["https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NjgB-Bq83B45hLUqYQdn9BsBtIL0cx8o/view"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x827297514aeDdBae95d72B77373d0e1a00183Aae"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/AutoSteak", "https://discord.gg/cY7vCzeKGd"], "announcement": ["https://t.me/AutoSteakAnnouncements"], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/autosteak"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x827297514aeDdBae95d72B77373d0e1a00183Aae", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x827297514aeDdBae95d72B77373d0e1a00183Aae", "contractDecimals": 8, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.39573307597338, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.99695168, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.65196276}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.13951826462414, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.41720606, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.23403521}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04642130446666, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47479612, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76378252}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34543127132665, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.10634214, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.07975349}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08809375205785, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47012283, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.20479819}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3365804189963, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.72571723, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.81210172}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.61551425760311, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.84200543, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.02118715}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12756201108951, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.48873139, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44700682}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04698230570444, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32158169, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.92562492}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:33:57.778Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
