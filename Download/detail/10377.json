The content and streaming market according to \u201cgrandviewresearch.com\u201d is an estimated $59billion. Besides the rapid increase in population of active smart users, most people like to play around, throw a few challenges or participate in some private or mass challenges either in person or over the internet. We go into bets and dares with another party or group of people. In most instances, do we get rewarded for participating in challenges or dares? What happens to biases by third parties and regulations?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Daretoken?\r\n\r\nDareToken is a revolutionary P2P-platform that drives participation in challenges and online competitions. We are not trying to create an entire blockchain or another bitcoin. We simply want to bridge the gap between the world and blockchain technology by creating a tool for mass adoption. Our platform will enable each participant to launch and accept challenges and competition, provide video footage and other forms of proof of contents and get ratings and rewards based on the results and community voting systems. With a total and max supply of 800million tokens, DRE will be used as a native currency to fuel all platform features, in-app purchases, reward schemes and for partaking in personal, private and mass challenges. Team and advisor tokens will be locked for two years in order to ensure all deliverables are met before tokens are unlocked.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho are the founders? \r\n\r\nFounded by Roland Quaye, A certified application consultant with Sage South Africa, Middle East and SAP employee central academy. A blockchain advocate and influencer in his local community, an investor, trader and implementer with over 6 years experience in the cryptocurrency industry. Our advisors are made up of LEAD WALLET CEO and the Associate Product Manager of Jam City.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaretoken will function mainly in these sectors:\r\n\r\nFun and Games \u2014 Have fun with your friends and other users of the platform\r\n\r\nMonetization of content \u2014 Make money from uploading contents and proof of challenges/competitions\r\n\r\nPassive income from staking\u2014 Stake your Dare token, BNB, USDT etc and earn passive income from completed dares and reward systems through platform commission distribution\r\n\r\nEasy and efficient Cash Out \u2014 Cash out rewards to fiat payment systems or to your crypto wallet\r\n\r\nParticipate in ongoing group and mass challenges, become famous and also earn money\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes Daretoken unique?\r\n\r\nBased on research gathered from biteable.com and statista.com the funtech markets has a lot of untapped potential which we will focus on harnessing using blockchain as the backbone of operations. Users will not only focus on the financial markets but also have fun and also earn some money through our reward schemes and competition ranges.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-09T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:51:03.000Z", "watchCount": "1296", "dateLaunched": "2021-02-28T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://daretoken.io/"], "technical_doc": ["https://daretoken.docsend.com/view/iahrus96emi6apg2"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xd589699b20903fc061701ad6a35cb78bb5dd734e"], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://daretoken.medium.com/"], "chat": [], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/DareToken"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/DareToken"]}, "volume": 4646.28050463, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 101.2497, "statistics": {"price": 0.00124923611286, "priceChangePercentage1h": -1.86957815, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.66051627, "priceChangePercentage7d": 63.30734207, "priceChangePercentage30d": -1.29367034, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 999388.89, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 800000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4330, "low24h": 0.00107926, "high24h": 0.00140029, "low7d": 0.00073102, "high7d": 0.00142311, "low30d": 0.00069948, "high30d": 0.00168232, "low90d": 0.00069948, "high90d": 0.00363416, "low52w": 0.00069948, "high52w": 0.00363416, "lowAllTime": 0.00069948, "highAllTime": 0.00363416, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 78.59, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -65.63, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-23T17:57:20.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-24T18:33:03.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00107926, "highYesterday": 0.00115939, "openYesterday": 0.00113232, "closeYesterday": 0.00114269, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0.92, "volumeYesterday": 0, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xd589699b20903fc061701ad6a35cb78bb5dd734e", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xd589699b20903fc061701ad6a35cb78bb5dd734e", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.93913845067335, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10541915, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.63438799}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33773955512395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.23981776, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.41715042}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04592046794645, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.23029735, "priceChangePercentage7d": 17.9758293}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08803051270921, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32754572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.77415107}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.86320486217138, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.14307618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6744906}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884102685655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.39973257, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44788409}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:51:44.408Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
