{"data": {"id": 8216, "name": "Electra Protocol", "symbol": "XEP", "slug": "electra-protocol", "category": "coin", "description": "What is Electra Protocol\n\nElectra Protocol is a proof-of-stake open-source platform that runs on an ever-developing and improving blockchain. Its core purpose is to build a fast and secure cryptocurrency that allows transactions to occur at a considerably lower than average processing fee rate. \n\nWith a team of coordinators and developers from across the globe, this community-based project aims to be the first and most widely used cryptocurrency on the market. With its native coin XEP, Electra Protocol perceives itself as becoming a popular payment processing option, using data money without the complexities of the current forms of payment infrastructures. \n\nElectra Protocol Features\n\nElectra Protocol by itself is a standalone, ultra-fast, and secure form of data money with near-zero processing fees. When placed together with its flagship product, ElectaPay, one can witness its true potential.  \n\nElectraPay is a payment solution for e-commerce merchants who are looking for the alternative payment methods that cryptocurrency provides. In other words, it is a complete financial management system that will allow merchants to quickly adopt an alternative payment method that is not dependent upon payment service providers, banks, or credit card companies to complete transactions. This unique payment solution will offer many advantages that traditional payment platforms fail to give merchants. These benefits include lower transaction fees, immediate access to funds, and state-of-the-art security provided by the Electra Protocol blockchain, all while maintaining an incredibly fast transaction speed. \n\nIn regards to the client end, ElectraPay will offer the same advantages of speed and security. In the event there is a problem with the transaction, ElectraPay will automatically refund the customer, which is an unusual feature in the crypto world.\n\nWhat Makes Electra Protocol Unique\n\nOne of Electra Protocol's unique selling proposition is the project's community. When looking at social media channels such as Telegram, Discord, Twitter, and Facebook, the project has shown strong community growth as others learn about Electra Protocol. The Electra Protocol core team's average age is over 35 years old, with the majority of team members bringing more than 15 years of professional business experience to the table, which has greatly supported the project's business development. \n\nIn addition to ElectraPay, Electra Protocol is expanding its scope from not only being a payment focused coin to a project that can facilitate multiple use cases. An example of this is a pilot currently taking place with a company in the food production industry that uses the Electra Protocol blockchain for product traceability in its supply chain. The first responses from the company's international customers are very positive. This feedback has encouraged the team to continue to explore this path.\n\n The Electra Protocol team is currently working towards a business model that will provide partners with all the necessary software and tools to enable the project's technology monetization. First contacts with European companies have been established, with interest in utilizing either the Electra Protocol Ecosystem or a refurbished closed source version of it. \n\nElectra Protocol takes great pride in the fact that it is a member of the prestigious Electronic Transactions Association (ETA). Among ETA members are such names as Google, Amazon, Bank of America, Apple, and Worldpay. As a member, Electra Protocol is taking its seat and joining committees that contribute to ETA's focus on payment technologies. The opportunity to be a part of the association will help Electra Protocol as it continues to grow its network of key industry groups and individuals.", "dateAdded": "2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:25:04.000Z", "watchCount": "2341", "dateLaunched": "2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [{"slug": "pos", "name": "PoS", "category": "CONSENSUS_ALGORITHM"}, {"slug": "medium-of-exchange", "name": "Medium of Exchange", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "logistics", "name": "Logistics", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "atomic-swaps", "name": "Atomic Swaps", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "17801801691.586414", "urls": {"website": ["https://electraprotocol.com"], "technical_doc": ["https://www.electraprotocol.com/whitepaper/"], "explorer": ["https://electraprotocol.network/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/ElectraProtocol"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/@electraprotocol", "https://www.electraprotocol.com/news-room"], "chat": ["https://t.me/ElectraProtocol", "https://discord.gg/eCSQMJsKpw"], "announcement": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectraProtocol/"], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/ElectraProtocol"]}, "volume": 35127.18734131, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 27.4864, "statistics": {"price": 0.00108287893959, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.03534433, "priceChangePercentage24h": 14.32541242, "priceChangePercentage7d": 8.69112656, "priceChangePercentage30d": -12.27628448, "priceChangePercentage60d": -27.58347984, "priceChangePercentage90d": -54.46157437, "marketCap": 19326499.79, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 14.329, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 32486368.19, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": -8.17, "circulatingSupply": 17847331852.40003, "totalSupply": 17764656765.0, "maxSupply": 30000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0012, "rank": 660, "low24h": 0.00088448, "high24h": 0.0011757, "low7d": 0.00080549, "high7d": 0.0011757, "low30d": 0.00071894, "high30d": 0.00140714, "low90d": 0.00071894, "high90d": 0.00275066, "low52w": 0.00071894, "high52w": 0.00364294, "lowAllTime": 0.00071894, "highAllTime": 0.00364294, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 50.62, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -70.27, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-21T21:32:02.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-02-06T14:47:02.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00088448, "highYesterday": 0.0011757, "openYesterday": 0.00114233, "closeYesterday": 0.00106279, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -6.96, "volumeYesterday": 30498.92, "turnover": 0.00181757, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 3718, "name": "BitTorrent", "slug": "bittorrent", "price": 0.00284466575101, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.72245268, "priceChangePercentage7d": 28.68713831}, {"id": 4760, "name": "PANTHEON X", "slug": "pantheon-x", "price": 0.00557238721101, "priceChangePercentage24h": -0.01555664, "priceChangePercentage7d": 94.48829911}, {"id": 2699, "name": "Sharder", "slug": "sharder", "price": 0.0046160786534, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.16036568, "priceChangePercentage7d": 71.44522967}, {"id": 4778, "name": "ebakus", "slug": "ebakus", "price": 0.00039346791541, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.22371251, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.60325864}, {"id": 2700, "name": "Celsius", "slug": "celsius", "price": 6.14763521167166, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.83325519, "priceChangePercentage7d": 3.81642998}, {"id": 1, "name": "Bitcoin", "slug": "bitcoin", "price": 41722.79258831723, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.40748567, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.92636329}, {"id": 74, "name": "Dogecoin", "slug": "dogecoin", "price": 0.20850019592913, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.49742075, "priceChangePercentage7d": 7.83993003}, {"id": 131, "name": "Dash", "slug": "dash", "price": 163.90812663994885, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.62508491, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.19442983}, {"id": 6538, "name": "Curve DAO Token", "slug": "curve-dao-token", "price": 1.71762976374205, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.78644019, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.5525873}, {"id": 873, "name": "NEM", "slug": "nem", "price": 0.17321618477633, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.11030745, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.9609604}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 400, "name": "Hotbit", "slug": "hotbit"}, {"id": 514, "name": "Finexbox", "slug": "finexbox"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Bittrex", "slug": "bittrex"}, {"id": 487, "name": "VinDAX", "slug": "vindax"}, {"id": 382, "name": "Crex24", "slug": "crex24"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:26:07.378Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "16", "credit_count": 0}}
