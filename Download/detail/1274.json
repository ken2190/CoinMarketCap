{"data": {"id": 1274, "name": "Waves", "symbol": "WAVES", "slug": "waves", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Waves (WAVES)?\n\nWaves is a multi-purpose [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform which supports various use cases including decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) and [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).\n\nLaunched in June 2016 following one of the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s earliest initial coin offerings ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)), Waves initially set out to improve on the first blockchain platforms by increasing speed, utility and user-friendliness. \n\nThe platform has undergone various changes and added new spin-off features to build on its original design. \n\nWaves\u2019 native token is WAVES, an uncapped supply token used for standard payments such as block rewards.  \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Waves?\n\nWaves is synonymous with its founder, Ukrainian-born scientist Alexander Ivanov (also known as Sasha Ivanov).\n\nPrior to creating Waves, Ivanov was already active in the cryptocurrency space, having released the now-defunct instant exchange Coinomat and indexing site Cooleindex. He also created an early version of a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin), CoinoUSD, tied to the U.S. dollar.\n\nIvanov is publicly active in his promotion of Waves, giving frequent interviews on the platform and trends in the wider blockchain industry.\n\nAccording to Waves\u2019 marketing literature, the company now employs over 180 people at locations including Moscow and Switzerland.  \n\n\n### What Makes Waves Unique?\n\nAs one of the first offerings in its field, Waves set out to improve on the early blockchain platforms and products. \n\nFrom the outset, it aimed to appeal to prospective business clients looking to use blockchain to improve processes or create new services.\n\nWaves supported smart contract and DApp development, ensuring that speeds and ease-of-use surpassed competition at the time. \n\nSince then, other products have appeared, including Gravity, a cross-chain and oracle network, and decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) focused platform Neutrino. Waves DEX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIn 2020, Waves announced that its platform would be interoperable with the Ethereum network by releasing the WAVES token as an ERC-20 standard asset. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn more about Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) here.\n\nLearn more about Cardano ([ADA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/)) here.\n\nNew to crypto? Find out everything you need to know with [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics), CoinMarketCap\u2019s dedicated education resource.\n\n\n#### How Many Waves (WAVES) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nWAVES began as a fixed-cap token for the Waves platform with 100 million tokens available. \n\nIn its ICO \u2014 which raised 30,000 BTC \u2014 85% of the supply went to sale participants, 4% to partners and supporters, 9% to the developers and 1% each to early supporters and bounty schemes which occurred after the ICO.\n\nIts utility increased in time, and in 2019, it was decided to remove the supply cap, with decision-making transferred to network participants.\n\nCurrently, the block reward is 6 WAVES, and any changes come in the form of votes \u2014 users must choose whether or not to decrease the block reward by 0.5 WAVES every 110,000 blocks.\n\n\n### How Is the Waves Network Secured?\n\nWaves uses a modified [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) algorithm called WavesNG. The technology is based on Bitcoin-NG, a scaling proposal by well-known Bitcoin advocate, Cornell University developer Emin G\u00fcn Sirer.\n\nWaves highlights that its code is open source, allowing for more trust and ease of maintenance than closed source enterprise blockchain solutions. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Waves (WAVES)?\n\nWAVES, as a cryptocurrency on the market for over four years, is widely tradable on a large number of exchanges. \n\nPairs operate between WAVES and other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies. \n\nVolumes are highly distributed, with [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) among the largest market venues.\n\nCryptocurrency newbie?
