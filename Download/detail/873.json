{"data": {"id": 873, "name": "NEM", "symbol": "XEM", "slug": "nem", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is NEM (XEM)?\n\nNEM (New Economy Movement) is an ecosystem of platforms that use [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) and cryptography to provide solutions for businesses and individuals. XEM is the native cryptocurrency of NEM\u2019s NIS1 public blockchain.\n\nNIS1 operates in a similar way to Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)): it has a network of distributed independent nodes that process and record transactions on a public ledger called \u201cblockchain.\u201d These nodes are incentivized to contribute their time and computing resources and remain incorruptible via transaction fee rewards; these rewards are paid out in XEM coins to each node that manages to add a new block of transactions to the end of the blockchain.\n\nHowever, NIS1\u2019s blockchain has a number of unique features that set it apart from Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe alpha version of NIS1 \u2014 or NEM as it was known at that time \u2014 was launched on June 25, 2014, and its mainnet went live on March 31, 2015.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of NEM?\n\nNEM was originally created by three developers known by their pseudonyms on the Bitcointalk.org forum: Jaguar0625, BloodyRookie and gimre. Since its inception in 2014-2015, NEM has grown from a personal project of three programmers to a large ecosystem composed of several platforms.\n\nNEM\u2019s overall development and promotion is now managed by NEM Group. NEM Group is a parent company designed to support the growth of the NEM ecosystem leading up to the launch of Symbol (NEM 2.0) and beyond.  NEM Group was formed by a team of experienced NEM representatives and enterprise veterans who realized that a simplified structure would benefit the entire ecosystem, while also promoting more community input and engagement. The NEM Group Board of Directors is responsible for setting the strategy and budgets, and ensuring that all subsidiaries are working towards collective objectives. NEM Group comprises three separate entities: NEM Software, focused on the product and business development; NEM Trading, responsible for all finances, including liquidity management, exchange support and token lending; and NEM Ventures, the venture capital and investment arm, focused on strategic partnerships.\n\n#### What Makes NEM Unique?\n\nXEM is a decentralized open-source cryptocurrency that has a number of unique features.\n\nPerhaps the most important of these is the way the NIS1 blockchain is secured. NIS1 uses its own proof-of-importance (PoI) algorithm \u2014 as opposed to the far more widespread [proof-of-work and proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) \u2014 for the purpose of ensuring that transactions on the network are processed and recorded in a timely and honest manner.\n\nProof-of-importance allows anyone to run a node on the NIS1 network and facilitate transactions via a process called \u201cdelegated harvesting.\u201d The system takes into account every node\u2019s amount of already held coins, how often they transact on the network and who they transact with, in order to approximate their \u201cimportance score\u201d in NEM\u2019s economy. Based on this score, the nodes then receive a share of the fees from the transactions they have helped to process.\n\nNEM claims that the proof-of-importance system ensures that the network can identify and reward those that actually use it the most.\n\nIn addition to its unique PoI algorithm, NIS1 also supports such features as multisignature account contracts, encrypted messaging, the Eigentrust++ reputation system and the Apostille service for notarizing and checking the authenticity of files on blockchain.\n\nAnother important market for NIS1 are enterprise-level solutions: through a purpose-built API system, NEM allows developers to integrate its blockchain infrastructure into third-party applications. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about crypto on CoinMarketCap\u2019s new educational platform [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics).\n\nCheck out CMC\u2019s [blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many NEM (XEM) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of XEM is 8.999 billion coins, all of which were created since the launch of the network \u2014 no new XEM can be mined. The network nodes are incentivized to process transactions via the distribution of fees on the transactions that are included in each new block.\n\n\n### How Is the NEM Network Secured?\n\nTo secure its network, NEM uses Ed25519 public-key signature system and the SHA3 hash algorithm.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy NEM (XEM)?\n\nIt is possible to [buy XEM](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-XEM) or use trading pairs that are available, such as:\n\n*   [Zaif](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/zaif/)\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*
