{"data": {"id": 3794, "name": "Cosmos", "symbol": "ATOM", "slug": "cosmos", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Cosmos (ATOM)?\n\n In a nutshell, Cosmos bills itself as a project that solves some of the \u201chardest problems\u201d facing the blockchain industry. It aims to offer an antidote to \u201cslow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful\u201d [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains.\n\nThe project\u2019s other goals include making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers thanks to a modular framework that demystifies decentralized apps. Last but not least, an Interblockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other \u2014 preventing fragmentation in the industry.\n\nCosmos\u2019 origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published \u2014 and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project\u2019s flagship blockchain, secure. This cryptocurrency also has a role in the network\u2019s governance.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Cosmos?\n\nThe co-founders of Tendermint \u2014 the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem \u2014 were Jae Kwon, Zarko Milosevic and Ethan Buchman. Although Kwon is still listed as principal architect, he stepped down as CEO in 2020. He maintains he is still a part of the project but is mainly focusing on other initiatives. He has now been replaced as Tendermint\u2019s CEO by Peng Zhong, and the whole board of directors was given quite a substantial refresh. Their goals include enhancing the experience for developers, creating an enthusiastic community for Cosmos and building educational resources so greater numbers of people are aware of what this network is capable of.\n\n### What Makes Cosmos Unique?\n\n\nA major concern for some in the crypto industry centers on the levels of fragmentation seen in blockchain networks. There are hundreds in existence, but very few of them can communicate with each other. Cosmos aims to turn this on its head by making this possible.\n\nCosmos is described as \u201cBlockchain 3.0\u201d \u2014 and as we mentioned earlier, a big goal is ensuring that its infrastructure is straightforward to use. To this end, the Cosmos software development kit focuses on modularity. This allows a network to be easily built using chunks of code that already exist. Long-term, it\u2019s hoped that complex applications will be straightforward to construct as a result. \n\nScalability is another priority, meaning substantially more transactions can be processed a second than more old-fashioned blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If blockchains are to ever achieve mainstream adoption, they\u2019ll need to be able to cope with demand as well as existing payment processing companies or websites \u2014 or be even better.\n\n[Check out simple definitions for crypto terms in our glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary)\n\n[Learn about blockchain basics with CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/)\n\n[Read the latest features in our blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n### How Many Cosmos (ATOM) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nATOM has a very specific total supply \u2014 260,906,513 to be exact. Of these, at the time of writing, about 203,121,910 were in circulation. It is worth noting that these cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t mined \u2014 instead, they are earned through [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking).\n\nTwo private sales were held in January 2017, followed by a public sale in April of that year. This raised a total of $16 million, which is the equivalent of about $0.10 per ATOM.\n \nBreaking down the token distribution, about 80% was allocated to investors, while the remaining 20% was split between two companies: All In Bits and the Interchain Foundation.\n\nCosmos has compared ATOM tokens to the ASICs that are used to mine Bitcoin. As a technical paper written by the Tendermint team explained: \u201cIt is a piece of virtualized hardware (economic capital) that you need to obtain in order to participate as a keeper in the network.\u201d\n\n\n### How Is the Cosmos Network Secured?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Cosmos uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Validator nodes that stake a higher quantity of ATOM tokens are more likely to be chosen to verify transactions and earn rewards. Nodes that are found to be acting dishonestly are penalized \u2014 and they can end up losing the tokens that they had at stake.\n\n### Where Can You Buy Cosmos (ATOM)?\n\nIt is now available across a number of major exchanges \u2014 many people choose to [buy Cosmos](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Cosmos) on Binance, Coinbase and OKEx. It\u2019s possible to find trading pairs with a number of fiat currencies, and you can find more about the process of converting dollars and euros to crypto[
