{"data": {"id": 7870, "name": "Plasma Finance", "symbol": "PPAY", "slug": "plasma-finance", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Plasma Finance (PPAY)?\n\n[Plasma Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/plasma-finance/) is a cross-chain [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) aggregator that allows users to easily manage their portfolios from a single, straightforward interface. The dashboard can be easily unlocked through any [Web 3.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0) wallet.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Plasma Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-plasma-finance).\n\nPlasma Finance bills itself as the home for DeFi. The dashboard brings together the most popular DeFi protocols in one place. The platform was created to ensure the democratization of the DeFi market, reduce difficulties and barriers to entry and open up access to all user groups. The creators of the project aim to offer universal solutions that will be appreciated by both beginners and experienced participants.\n\nThe goal of the developers is to create a user-friendly and simplified dashboard, with universal access to the best DeFi tools, thus promoting cryptocurrencies to the masses. Plasma Finance acts as a bridge between traditional and decentralized financial markets. It offers a range of advanced financial tools with industry-leading UX, and provides an easy way to connect [fiat on-ramps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fiat-on-ramp) and off-ramps for users. Plasma Finance users can send, exchange and request payments. They can also deposit and withdraw digital assets with one click.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Plasma Finance?\n\nPlasma Finance started from the creation of PlasmaPay _\u2014_ a non-custodial desktop and mobile crypto wallet with global on- and off-ramps capabilities. The company was established in June 2017 by [Ilia Maksimenka](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/author/ilia-maksimenka). Today, PlasmaPay is a global payments and transfer platform available in over 160 countries, providing crypto and [fiat](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fiat) wallets, fiat on/off ramps, and DeFi services and infrastructure for consumer and commercial use. Plasma Alliance is the ecosystem that houses PlasmaPay, Plasma Finance and PlasmaDLT _\u2014_ the Plasma Blockchain.\n\nIlia Maksimenka is the CEO of PlasmaPay and Plasma Finance. He received an MA in economics from Plekhanov Russian University of Economics and an MBA from McGill University. Prior to PlasmaPay, Maksimenka headed International Business Development at Coursmos _\u2014_ an open educational platform. He has also worked in corporate finance, stock exchange and financial technology; he was a technical analyst in the government and a fund manager in a private investment bank. From 2010 to 2016, he founded a range of startups in the finance and artificial intelligence field. Maksimenka has been in the crypto space since 2013; he\u2019s engaged in the implementation of financial infrastructures, product development and business growth.\n\n\n## What Makes Plasma Finance (PPAY) Unique?\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bthe Plasma Finance developers comes down to one point _\u2014_ to make decentralized finance available to everyone, without exception, and provide people with financial freedom through DeFi. Plasma Finance houses the most well-known protocols under one roof, providing the platform with a set of tools that the average user can understand, but sophisticated enough for institutional investors. Plasma Finance believes in leveling the playing field between large institutions and individuals. According to the project team, financial services should be decentralized, transparent, censorship resistant and accessible. \n\nThe long-term goal of the project is as follows: \u201cDeFi for the masses.\u201d Therefore, the developers want to show everyone that using DeFi with Plasma Finance is a simple, convenient, understandable, and most importantly, safe process.\n\nThe dashboard contains all the necessary DeFi tools: portfolio management; fiat on/off ramp; liquidity pools; dex & swap aggregator; lending & borrowing; cross-chain asset swap. With the fiat ramps, users can easily buy tokens from a card or bank account. Moreover, the platform has collected some of the best profitability strategies. The team has combined all DeFi assets, liquidity pools and savings deposits, allowing users to quickly compare and find the right option.\n\nTo make things simpler and save your time, the dashboard also offers auto-calculations of APY and P&L. In addition, you can choose your ROI from over a hundred cross-chain (Ethereum, Binance, Plasma) liquidity pools available on the platform.\n\nFurthermore, in June 2021, Plasma Finance launched SpacePort _\u2014_ their democratized, open [IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-dex-offering) launchpad built on the PlasmaSwap DEX. In line with their goal, projects of any size and setup now have the same opportunity to access open, transparent and fairer means of crowdfunding on DeFi. Plasma Finance also houses their Launchpad Alliance \u2013 an overview of popular IDO platforms like PAID Ignition, DuckSTARTER, Polkastarter, Poolz and DAO Maker.\n\nSo, to sum up, Plasma Finance supports the following features: swap, cross-chain swap, savings account, liquidity pools, market overview, governance, portfolio management, onboarding, borrow and launchpad.
