If in Bitcoin (BTC) we are familiar with the Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol then at Satozhi (SATOZ) a better protocol is made, known as Proof-of-Burn (PoB). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow does the Proof-of-Burn (PoB) protocol work? \r\n\r\nSatozhi (SATOZ) is the first token in the world to use this new protocol. This protocol uses the logic of burning the token supply in the block chain, and then creating a new token in the pool every 10 minutes. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages of Satozhi's Proof-of-Burn (PoB)? \r\n\r\nThe Proof-of-Burn (PoB) protocol is an improvement over the 12-year-old Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol. Unlike the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol where you must have mining equipment in the form of a GPU, CPU, or ASIC. Proof-of-Burn (PoW) allows you to earn block rewards directly on your blockchain wallet. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between Satozhi (SATOZ) and other tokens? \r\n\r\nSatozhi (SATOZ) allows you to save, trade, multiply, give a gift, and get block prizes without having to spend money, effort, and time to stay on the decentralized application (DAPP) all the time. Satozhi (SATOZ) can be stored anywhere, and will continue to work according to the Proof-of-Burn (PoB) protocol. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat if the SATOZ supply is too much? \r\n\r\nThe goal of Satozhi (SATOZ) was created with the Proof-of-Burn (PoB) protocol is that tokens must be burned first to get block rewards and increase the circulation supply. The supply of Satozhi tokens (SATOZ) will not be able to increase if there is no burning, the more amount you burn, the less the remaining supply is circulating. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen should I start Satozhi (SATOZ)? \r\n\r\nIf you are an investor or market trader, today's token supply remains half of the initial total Satozhi (SATOZ) supply of 21 million tokens, and prices will soar when the token supply is low after being burned. If you are a minter, now is the perfect time because your percentage of your Proof-of-Burn (PoB) pool is still very profitable. \r\n\r\nHow to Rewards on SATOZ? \r\n\r\nTo get a Rewards, you must burn your token on Satoz Platform. after doing this, the reward will be distributed 50 Satoz every 10 minutes with an even distribution of the total tokens burned. Rewards will be obtained forever until the total tokens back to 21 millions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow does the Proof-of-Burn (PoB) protocol work? \r\n\r\nSatozhi (SATOZ) is the first token in the world to use this new protocol. This protocol uses the logic of burning the token supply in the block chain, and then creating a new token in the pool every 10 minutes.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active",
