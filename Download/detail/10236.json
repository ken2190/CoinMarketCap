Connecting, securing, and empowering all networks to continue innovating\r\nwhile retaining quantum supremacy. USX's mission is to unite the cryptocurrency community\r\nthrough education and collaboration with researchers and developers to secure and develop the\r\nfuture of quantum-based blockchains. We are living in the quantum era's infancy. USX will\r\ncreate blockchain quantum encryption by leveraging the power of quantum computers. This\r\npaves the way for transactions faster than the speed of light, which we will require in the\r\nfuture of space exploration, industry 4.0, and beyond. A unified society capable of laying the\r\ngroundwork for the next generation of encryption. We will leverage existing projects to acquire\r\nand develop the necessary technology. With a strong community, committed team members,\r\nand contributors, we are well on our way to success. One of the primary goals is to create a\r\nfree premium educational De-Fi platform where anyone on the planet can learn about a variety\r\nof subjects. Physics, chemistry, and computer science are just a few examples. We will provide\r\nan exceptional education to each user, thereby fostering future generations dedicated to the\r\nresearch and development of quantum-based blockchains. A platform that will enable students,\r\ndevelopers, researchers, and ordinary citizens to escape poverty and pursue their dreams.\r\nCreating a more sociable and friendly ecosystem for the benefit of humanity.
