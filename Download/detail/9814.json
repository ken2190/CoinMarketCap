The percentage of fees you earn is calculated by the percentage of $UNAGI that you own among holders. This generates a much higher yield than would otherwise be possible.\r\nThere is no team or central party that has to award the fees. There is no interface to claim the fees. No action needs to be taken on your part other than to hold $UNAGI in a wallet you control. \r\n6 main features of $UNAGI are as follow: \r\n1. $UNAGI is build and tested on Binance Smart Chain working as BEP-20 token.\r\n2. $UNAGI is 100% community-based project as no pre-sale and all token supply are added into PancakeSwap V2 liquidity.\r\n3. $UNAGI implemented with Anti-Pump-Dump methodology to reduce the possible of whales controlling the bull and bear of the market.\r\n4. $UNAGI Dev\u2019s team will spend 2 BNB to perform LP token locked on UniCrypt for 5 years.\r\n5. With $UNAGI LP tokens locked in UniCrypt for 5 years, deployer address will not be able to perform rug pull out of liquidity.\r\n6. $UNAGI with its RFI static earning model, HODLERS will get additional token as rewards as communities expand and new HODLERS joined.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-14T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "icoStatus": "untracked_ico", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "147", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-04T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "selfReportedTags": ["DeFi", "Smart Contracts", "Staking", "Yield Aggregator"], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "1.0E+9", "urls": {"website": ["https://www.unagiswap.finance/"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.unagiswap.finance/"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/address/0x7AA509D7761e35bf43B6AeB144480A19d0FEb851"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/UnagiSwap"], "message_board": ["https://unagiswapfinance.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/unagifinanceEN", "https://t.me/unagifinanceCN"], "announcement": ["https://t.me/unagiSwapFinance_announcement"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/unagiswap/"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/unagiswap"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x7AA509D7761e35bf43B6AeB144480A19d0FEb851", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x7AA509D7761e35bf43B6AeB144480A19d0FEb851", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.14770510434796, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.12304848, "priceChangePercentage7d": 53.83680601}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.08948521717125, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.05496242, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50256086}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0463266287478, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13415688, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.4756861}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34158907038751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.96859664, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.45374901}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08827561295395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.52347736, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.42732901}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33218429865312, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.34412525, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.45266776}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.65780294191658, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.60956613, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.69376176}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12744789978998, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.21786754, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.8643341}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04507747416068, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.01797293, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.73429399}], "relatedExchanges": [], "ico": {"cryptoId": 9814, "cryptoSymbol": "UNA", "status": "Ended", "cryptoStatus": 16, "name": "UNA", "statistic": {"tokensForSale": 399100000.0, "raisedInUsd": 0.0}, "distribution": [{"holder": "Public Sale", "percentage": 100}], "stages": [{"start": "2021-07-16T16:00:00.000Z", "end": "2021-07-16T18:00:00.000Z", "status": "Ended", "type": "IDO", "tokenForSale": 399100000, "icoPriceUsd": "0.00102", "softCapUsd": 240000, "personalCap": "0.1 BNB - 3 BNB", "distributedInIcoPercentage": 40.0, "access": "Public", "comments": "Access to https://unagiswap.finance/ and fill up interest registration form to be participate in IDO Celebration Events.
