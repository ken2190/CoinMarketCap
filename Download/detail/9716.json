{"data": {"id": 9716, "name": "SpaceCorgi", "symbol": "SCORGI", "slug": "spacecorgi", "category": "token", "description": "SpaceCorgi is a pet service-oriented autostaking, deflationary, utility token. SpaceCorgi leverages memenomics with real-world token utility, establishing a shared utility network across the pet retail and service industries with interchangeable referral and reward programs.\r\n\r\n## TRACTION / PARTNER NETWORK\r\n- Initially, SpaceCorgi will be accepted by Scoopers.club, a dog waste removal app, as a form of payment.\r\n- Scoopers will also leverage SpaceCorgi for referral and rewards programs.\r\n- As additional pet partners join the utility network, SpaceCorgi will function as an interchangeable and frictionless value store. \r\n\r\n## LAUNCH\r\nRFI tokenomics and auto-liquidity generation are maintained as staples of SpaceCorgi. SpaceCorgi is a fair launch following these steps:\r\n- Dev minted tokens.\r\n- Dev sent the balance to DxSale for a fair launch. 3% of tokens are reserved in marketing wallet for community benefit.\r\n- Remainder of tokens are burned.\r\n- DxSale protocol is utilized to foster trust by auto-locking liquidity.\r\n- SpaceCorgi is a community-owned token.\r\n\r\n## TOKENOMICS\r\n- A liquidity fee of 3% is taken from every transaction.\r\n- 1% is redistributed to holders in reflection.\r\n- Total Supply: 1000 Trillion\r\n- Initial Burn: 500 Trillion\r\n- Symbol: SCORGI\r\n- Decimal: 9\r\n\r\n## DEFLATIONARY BURNS \r\nBurning the supply of $SCORGI increases the price through deflation. Contrary to many mining or staking projects that burn tokens from what they mint, our burns are real-world, permanent depletion from the circulating supply. Originally, we burned these coins by sending them to the burn wallet (0xdead) after minting them for the autostaking calculation; however, this is not considered a burn because these coins were deposited in the burn wallet before circulation. By making all the tokens scarcer with every transaction, a real deflation will push the price higher. Initially, the burn address consists of 50% of the total $SCORGI supply, so it will receive half of the 1% fee with every transaction. With time, the burn wallet will account for more than 50% of the total transactions, and it will consume a greater proportion of the 1% transaction and becomes more deflationary.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-11T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:36:06.000Z", "watchCount": "5298", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://spacecorgi.finance"], "technical_doc": ["https://assets.website-files.com/6085da5236345d6d2672750c/6093433df33467290f185a36_SpaceCorgi.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x5a81b31b4a5f2d2a36bbd4d755dab378de735565"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/SpaceCorgi/SpaceCorgi"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/SpaceCorgiDiscussion"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/SpaceCorgi"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/scorgi_official"]}, "volume": 2736.60433266, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -51.8151, "statistics": {"price": 1.66245e-09, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.16558127, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.50712504, "priceChangePercentage7d": -18.50664455, "priceChangePercentage30d": -37.22939257, "priceChangePercentage60d": -66.60067318, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 831224.08, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 36.11, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 1000000000000000.0, "maxSupply": 500000000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4455, "low24h": 0.0, "high24h": 0.0, "low7d": 0.0, "high7d": 0.0, "low30d": 0.0, "high30d": 1e-08, "low90d": 0.0, "high90d": 2e-08, "low52w": 0.0, "high52w": 2e-08, "lowAllTime": 0.0, "highAllTime": 2e-08, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 0, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -91.69, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-05-24T03:07:07.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-05-17T20:04:07.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.0, "highYesterday": 0, "openYesterday": 0.0, "closeYesterday": 0.0, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0, "volumeYesterday": 7466.88, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x5a81b31b4a5f2d2a36bbd4d755dab378de735565", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x5a81b31b4a5f2d2a36bbd4d755dab378de735565", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.14770510434796, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.12304848, "priceChangePercentage7d": 53.83680601}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.08948521717125, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.05496242, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50256086}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0463266287478, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13415688, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.4756861}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34158907038751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.96859664, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.45374901}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08827561295395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.52347736, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.42732901}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33218429865312, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.34412525, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.45266776}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.65780294191658, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.60956613, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.69376176}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12744789978998, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.21786754, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.8643341}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04507747416068, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.01797293, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.73429399}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:36:50.242Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
