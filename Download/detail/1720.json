{"data": {"id": 1720, "name": "IOTA", "symbol": "MIOTA", "slug": "iota", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is IOTA (MIOTA)?\n\n** **\n\nIOTA is a distributed ledger with one big difference: it isn\u2019t actually a blockchain. Instead, its proprietary technology is known as Tangle, a system of nodes that confirm transactions. The foundation behind this platform says this offers far greater speeds than conventional blockchains \u2014 and an ideal footprint for the ever-expanding Internet of Things ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [IOTA](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-iota).\n \n\nBecause there\u2019s no blockchain, there are no miners, and because there are no miners, there are no fees. Many established networks see costs balloon when congestion intensifies, but IOTA aims to provide limitless throughput at minimal expense.\n\n \n\nIn time, IOTA\u2019s goal is to become the de facto platform for executing transactions between IoT devices. Given how estimates suggest there could be 20.4 billion such devices out there by 2024, this could end up being big business.\n\n \n\nThe team behind IOTA believe that the potential use cases don\u2019t end here. They believe their distributed ledger could deliver digital identities to all, result in car insurance policies that are based on actual usage, pave the way for cutting-edge smart cities, deliver seamless global trade and prove the authenticity of products.\n\n \n\nOriginally known as Jinn, a crowdsale for the project was held in September 2014, and the network officially launched in 2016.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of IOTA?\n\n** **\n\nIOTA has [four co-founders](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/07/03/iota-cofounders-on-how-past-mistakes-have-shaped-them-today/), and their names are Sergey Ivancheglo, Serguei Popov, David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 and Dominik Schiener.\n\n \n\nAccording to the IOTA Foundation, the initiative has rapidly grown since then \u2014 and team members are now based across more than 25 countries.\n\n \n\nSonstebo and Schiener are collectively co-chairmen of the board of directors, while Popov is a board member and the foundation\u2019s director of research.\n\n \n\nIvancheglo resigned from the Berlin-based project back in June 2019 but continues as an unofficial advisor. At the time, he said in a statement: \u201cI no longer believe that the IOTA Foundation is the best setting for me to realize what we set out to create back in 2014 and 2015. I have always done my best work in a less rigid environment. I am looking forward to continuing the work on both hardware and software development of IOTA independently.\u201d\n\n\n### What Makes IOTA Unique?\n\n** **\n\nWell, as we alluded to a little earlier, the fact that it\u2019s effectively a blockchainless blockchain is rather unusual to say the least.\n\n \n\nTangle\u2019s more technical name is the Directed Acyclic Graph \u2014 and as S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 explained in a blog post back in 2015, this technology aims to retain blockchain\u2019s ability to execute secure transactions. The only difference is that it does away with the notion of blocks.\n\n \n\nHe also wrote: \u201cIOTA should not be considered an alternative coin (altcoin) to existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, rather it is an extension of the growing blockchain ecosystem. It\u2019s meant to work in synergy with these other platforms to form cohesion and symbiotic relationships. IOTA is designed to provide one solution that no other crypto does: efficient, secure, lightweight, real-time micro-transactions without fees.\u201d\n\n \n\nNew transactions are validated by approving two previous transactions from another node \u2014 and this is a novel approach because it means that the network\u2019s size and speed will be directly related to how many people are using the platform.\n\n \n\nAnd whereas some cryptocurrencies are run as a business, the IOTA Foundation says it is firmly not for profit \u2014 adding that it has the sole goal of making the network as prosperous as possible.\n\n \n\nFinally, IOTA has distinguished itself from many other crypto rivals by establishing high-profile partnerships with the carmaker Volkswagen, and helping the city of Taipei to pursue smart projects.\n\n \n\n[Read our deep dives into the latest crypto technology](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/tech-deep-dives)\n\n \n\n[The latest data on crypto\u2019s market cap and trading volumes](https://www.coinmarketcap.com/charts/)\n\n \n\n[Today\u2019s top stories in the crypto and blockchain industry](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/)\n\n \n\n[CoinMarketCap Blog: Analysis, opinion, news and updates](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n\n### How Many IOTA (MIOTA) Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\n** **\n\nMIOTA has a maximum supply of 2,779,530,283 tokens \u2014 and all of them are in circulation.\n\n \n\nWhen the crowdsale was held, this digital asset was billed as a utility token that could be used for payment across its network, rather than a profit-sharing coin.\n\n \n\nAn incredibly precise 999,999,999 were sold during the 2015 crowdsale, and this generated revenue of 1,337 BTC for the foundation. Given that Bitcoin was only worth about $325 at the time, this could have resulted in a substantial windfall for the team in later years.\n\n \n\nIt is worth noting that the supply of MIOTA did increase in later years, with the team arguing that a greater level of supply would make the token suitable for the \u201ctiny nano transactions\u201d that we\u2019ll likely see through IoT devices.\n\n \n\nThe IOTA Foundation launched in October 2017, and at the time, it owned approximately 5% of the tokens that are in circulation, and these were donated by the community. It said \u201cthe majority of these funds will go towards building an army of developers and researchers.\u201d\n\n\n### How Is the IOTA Network Secured?\n\n** **\n\nGiven how the IOTA network isn\u2019t a blockchain, you may not think that it would have much need for a consensus mechanism. However, to help keep the network secure, a relatively straightforward Proof-of-Work puzzle is included in the process of validating a transaction.\n\n \n\nThere have been security concerns surrounding IOTA. In the past, researchers have claimed they have found vulnerabilities in the project\u2019s code.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy IOTA (MIOTA)?\n\n** **\n\nMIOTA is available on multiple exchanges \u2014 many people choose to [buy MIOTA](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-MIOTA) on Binance, Bitfinex, and OKEx. According to the project, a range of trading pairs are available, linking the token with Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and fiat currencies including the Japanese yen, euro, pound, and dollar.[ Learn
