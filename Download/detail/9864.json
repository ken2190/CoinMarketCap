The energy will be used on our mining facilities and the coins that are going to be mined, a proportion of them will be distributed to our holders. ElonSpace is going to use artificial intelligence and smart software to determine which coin is more profitable so we and our holders generate more profit.\r\n\r\nThe team behind ElonSpace have great experience and knowledge in the blockchain industry. We have combined experts in mining, trading, developing and marketing professionals and strategists.\r\n\r\nGreen Energy is any energy type that is generated from natural resources, such as sunlight, wind or water. It often comes from renewable energy sources although there are some differences between renewable and green energy, which we will explore, below.\r\nThe key with these energy resources are that they don\u2019t harm the environment through factors such as releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\r\nGreen energy is important for the environment as it replaces the negative effects of fossil fuels with more environmentally-friendly alternatives. Derived from natural resources, green energy is also often renewable and clean, meaning that they emit no or few greenhouse gases and are often readily available.\r\n\r\nTypes of Green Energy ElonSpace will invest to produce:\r\n\r\n- Solar Power\r\n- Wind Power\r\n- Hydro Power\r\n\r\n \r\nThe energy target we are planning to reach is to produce 100 MW.\r\nCountries we are planning to have our main operations: \r\n- Sweden\r\n- Cyprus\r\n- Switzerland\r\n- N. Macedonia\r\n\r\n\r\nMining Facility is a location, usually a large space, housing several computers dedicated to mining one or more cryptocurrencies or tokes. In addition to using large amounts of electricity, the computers need to be replaced frequently. our aim is to build sustainable underwater state of the art mining farms to mine the most profitable coins with the help of AI and our professional traders.\r\n\r\nGovernance Elonspace token holders are bestowed upon rights to (delegate) debate, propose and vote on all changes to the protocol.\r\nToken usage Elonspace token purpose is to create a fair and sensitive ecosystem that will help to produce both clean energy and profits to all of its stakeholders.\r\nBurn Elonspace token is more than a governance token. Although discouraged, users are ultimately able to request to burn their tokens are withdraw a proportion of funds from the vault according to their private sale terms proportionately to their discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToken Metrics\r\n15,000 S19 PRO = 110TH/s\r\n15,000 x 110TH/s = 1,650,000TH/s \r\n1,650,000TH/s x 0.32$ = 528,000$\r\nThe earnings from the mining facility will be used for:\r\n- Fixed Costs\r\n- % to Holders\r\n- % Liquidity pool\r\n- % Marketing \r\n- % Re-Investing \r\n\r\n\r\nToken Distribution \r\nTotal token supply: ???????? \r\nToken private sale: ???????? \r\nPrivate sale terms: \r\n\u25cf 30% (???????) no lock-up \r\n\u25cf 30% (???????), 3-month lock-up \r\n\u25cf 40% (???????), 6-month lock-up Remaining token allocation \r\nBurn reserve: ???????
