He holds a degree certificate in physics and computer science from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nAnother LBRY co-founder is Alex Grintsvayg. Before Library Credit, Grintsvayg designed and managed system architecture for SaaS companies. At LBRY, he is responsible for technological development and overseeing the firm's infrastructure growth. \n\nLike Kaufman, Grintsvayg attended the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, from which he graduated with degrees in computer science and psychology. \n\nProtocol engineer Lex Berezhny is responsible for the backend of crucial components such as the platform's wallets, protocol and blockchain.\n\nBrannon King is a senior blockchain engineer at Library Credit. Before joining LBRY, Brannon created software in such languages as C++ and C#. \n\n\n#### What Makes Library Credit Unique?\n\nLibrary Credit uses the concept of a [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-decentralized-are-decentralized-networks) and [distributed network](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-distributed-ledger-technology-dlt) (across several host computers) to build a content sharing crypto platform that offers a level playing field for all participants.\n\nIt specifically seeks to solve some of the major problems (such as censorship, abuses of user privacy, unfair revenue sharing formula) that affect corporations that offer similar services. \n\nThe revenue generated from content consumers\u2019 activity is fully credited to publishers in their preferred payment method \u2014 whether in LBC (the native token) or through third-party processors.\n\nIndependent host providers can offer their computers\u2019 processing power to earn a passive income on the platform. This mechanism is expected to make LBRY affordable and appealing to content creators.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Steem](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/).\n\nFind out more about [Sapien](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sapien/).\n\nLearn more about [Web 3.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0).\n\nTake a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Library Credit (LBC) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nFor the first 20 years of the project, one billion (1,000,000,000) LBC tokens are set to be in circulation. However, that figure will decrease gradually on an annual basis, with about a hundred thousand (100,000,000) for the first year.\n\nAdditional reduction of the total supply will be incurred through bonus credits reserved for giveaway events, strategically meant to create initial public awareness. \n\nSee the full token allocation details below:\n\n\n\n*   10% for partner organizations, charity firms and other strategic institutions. These include the EFF, ACLU and others with a strong reputation in advocating for digital rights, cybersecurity and the Internet's freedom. \n*   20% for awareness programs. This allocation will be freely distributed at the early stage of the project to drive adoption among users. \n*   10% for the team, to cover operational costs and team expenses (human capital management).\n*   60% to be earned by the community via various activities, such as LBC mining.\n\n\n### How Is Library Credit Network Secured?\n\nThe network is secured via an end-to-end encryption technology that combines a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/why-nobody-can-hack-a-blockchain) model and DHT (distributed hash tables) data structure for encoding and retrieving data in a peer-to-peer exchange.\n\nAdditionally, LBRY prioritizes each publisher's intellectual property rights by using a robust record management system.\n\nAdditional measures such as hash modification, infringement penalties (defined in the DMCA) and processes that make infringements prohibitively expensive are continuously implemented to prevent other illegal activities. \n\nTo further prohibit intellectual property infringement, users are subjected to laws such as the DMCA.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Library Credit (LBC)?\n\nLBC tokens are a critical component of the LBRY network. As such, the platform cannot operate without sufficient liquidity. \n\nAt the time of writing, LBC is traded against different currency pairs on [exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/library-credit/) such as:\n\n\n\n*   [Upbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upbit/)\n*   [CoinEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinex/)\n*   [Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/)\n*   [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/)\n\nFor more info on how to buy LBC and other cryptos, see additional explanations [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/). \n", "dateAdded": "2016-07-07T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T08:37:07.000Z", "watchCount": "16845", "launchPrice": 0.646214, "tags": [{"slug": "mineable", "name": "Mineable", "category": "OTHER"}, {"slug": "marketplace", "name": "Marketplace", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "content-creation", "name": "Content Creation", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://lbry.com/", "https://lbry.fund/"], "technical_doc": ["https://lbry.tech"], "explorer": ["https://explorer.lbry.com", "https://explorer.lbry.com/api/v1/supply"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/lbryio"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://chat.lbry.com", "https://t.me/lbryofficial"], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5116826"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/lbry"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/LBRYcom"]}, "volume": 204438.79942528, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -11.1471, "statistics": {"price": 0.02926509225083, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.81453425, "priceChangePercentage24h": -2.27581413, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.31396844, "priceChangePercentage30d": 67.16870533, "priceChangePercentage60d": -70.39008487, "priceChangePercentage90d": -85.18372829, "marketCap": 15248716.99, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": -2.2758, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 31700006.46, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 14.6, "circulatingSupply": 521054806.7903623, "totalSupply": 705211760.0, "maxSupply": 1083202000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0009, "rank": 737, "roi": -95.47035623, "low24h": 0.02869803, "high24h": 0.03002844, "low7d": 0.02553864, "high7d": 0.03002844, "low30d": 0.01691681, "high30d": 0.03293098, "low90d": 0.01241156, "high90d": 0.20261673, "low52w": 0.01241156, "high52w": 0.52527806, "lowAllTime": 0.00510825, "highAllTime": 2.50399995, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 472.9, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -98.83, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2020-03-16T21:37:04.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2016-07-14T01:14:28.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.02752978, "highYesterday": 0.03002844, "openYesterday": 0.02801986, "closeYesterday": 0.02909127, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 3.82, "volumeYesterday": 225254.19, "turnover": 0.01340695, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": -75.4612}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 5692, "name": "Compound", "slug": "compound", "price": 401.5352143278061, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.68941871, "priceChangePercentage7d": -0.61637738}, {"id": 1, "name": "Bitcoin", "slug": "bitcoin", "price": 41695.862243321695, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.11468302, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.75413689}, {"id": 3631, "name": "FOAM", "slug": "foam", "price": 0.04053713373463, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.11127427, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.77507564}, {"id": 2, "name": "Litecoin", "slug": "litecoin", "price": 144.17557497584087, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.56320711, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.47613138}, {"id": 7083, "name": "Uniswap", "slug": "uniswap", "price": 21.28193154960951, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.45720824, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.91868263}, {"id": 7186, "name": "PancakeSwap", "slug": "pancakeswap", "price": 15.18091279360108, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.73624941, "priceChangePercentage7d": 9.06775664}, {"id": 501, "name": "Cryptonite", "slug": "cryptonite", "price": 0.00041725347626, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.20408916, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.84165009}, {"id": 6892, "name": "Elrond", "slug": "elrond-egld", "price": 88.79035545685925, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.41106502, "priceChangePercentage7d": 9.99795119}, {"id": 3602, "name": "Bitcoin SV", "slug": "bitcoin-sv", "price": 140.95824069751086, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.00069146, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.48190485}, {"id": 5830, "name": "NXM", "slug": "nxm", "price": 93.96712892691215, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.78080091, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.8491005}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 406, "name": "BitMart", "slug": "bitmart"}, {"id": 544, "name": "MEXC", "slug": "mxc"}, {"id": 330, "name": "BigONE", "slug": "bigone"}, {"id": 400, "name": "Hotbit", "slug": "hotbit"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Bittrex", "slug": "bittrex"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T08:37:34.987Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
