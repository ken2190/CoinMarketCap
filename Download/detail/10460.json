Built to last thanks to the PugDAO and never boring with a non-stop PugLottery. \r\n\r\nPUG is used for:\r\n\r\n* Governing the Pug.Cash community with the PugDAO.\r\n* Taking part in the non-stop PugLottery by holding at least 1 million PUG in a personal wallet.\r\n* Joining the PugClub communities by holding a minimum amount.\r\n* Farming by providing liquidity to the PancakeSwap pair BUSD/PUG.\r\n* More community utilities are being discussed and developed...\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Many PUG tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nPug.Cash deployed its token on April 30, 2021 with 100 billion PUG tokens.\r\nThe exact circulation of PUG change in time due to the unique tokenomics and fair launch and can only go down since PUG is deflationary (0.1% burned of every tx amount), no more PUG are going to be created.\r\n\r\nFair Launch:\r\n\r\n* The Bounce stage is what makes the project viable, an allocation of 5% of the supply is on bounce.finance and with the created liquidity enables the creation of the liquidity pools in the Kick Stage. \r\n\r\n* The Kick stage consists in the creation of two pools (PancakeSwap & ValueDefi) with 5% of the supply each. This will allow $PUG to go for a price discovery from a starting price lower than the Bounce Stage, since the supply is doubled (10%) and liquidity is the collected amount in Bounce Stage.\r\n\r\nThe motivation to have just 10% of the supply in the Kick Stage is to stop front-runners/speculators from getting most of the supply for pennies and dump at the first good occasion on the community.\r\nThe LP tokens of the created pools will be burned making a rug pull impossible.\r\n\r\n* The Balance stage consists in the creation of a Dodoex pool where 15% of the supply will be allocated with a starting price set by the market price that had 1 day to mature.\r\n\r\n* The Farm stage consists in the creation of a farming pool farm.pug.cash where 30% of the supply will be allocated and distributed during 1Y to LP of the BUSD/PUG pair on PanckaeSwap.\r\nAnother 30% is allocated for farming as well but looking to have it hosted with a possible PancakeSwap partnership as the community decided with a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of Pug.Cash?\r\n\r\nPug.Cash is community owned and the community give life to the token by enabling the token economy that we like to call Pugnomics. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Where Can I Buy Pug.Cash (PUG)?\r\n\r\nYou can find PUG on
