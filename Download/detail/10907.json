Currently, DOT holders stake into the relay chain to earn an estimated 14% \r\n*[2] annual return on their staked DOT. However, the staked DOT remains illiquid and it takes 28 days to unstake them. \r\n\r\nThis requires DOT holders to face a high opportunity cost when utilizing DOT in other decentralized applications as they have to forego their staking income. Additionally, users need to earn more than 14% in these protocols otherwise they should just take the risk-free rate from staking. Unfortunately, there are no live applications in the Polkadot ecosystem that allow users who have staked DOT to get liquidity.\r\nOur platform introduces a new financial primitive for staked DOT, which allows users to accrue interest from staking while still having a liquid asset not subject to lockups or lengthy unlock periods. This staked DOT financial primitive will be referred to as xDOT. Lenders will be able to earn interest income on their xDOT, and borrowers will be able to get loans against their DOT denominated in stable coins without selling their DOT.\r\n\r\n##  Heiko is brought to you by Parallel Finance\r\n\r\nParallel Finance Polychain, Pantera Capital, Polychain Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Breyer Capital, 8 Decimal Capital and Hypersphere Ventures.\r\n\r\nParallel Finance will be the Polkadot token while Heiko Finance is the Kusama Network counterpart.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "8", "dateLaunched": "2021-06-13T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://parallel.fi/heiko/index.html", "http://parallel.fi"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.parallel.fi/white-paper"], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://discord.gg/WX7PSz7RsP", "https://t.me/parallelfi_community"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/ParallelFi"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.15277603529009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97491332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.15383074}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.34964051346751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.48864478, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65721962}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04606059556592, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.60454635, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.52026324}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35073162374456, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.29500189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.00533147}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08805508567185, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49406181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.66853882}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33953608915345, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.35932698, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.52614735}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.81208358366918, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.33740637, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.63805644}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884983830176, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.8379087, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.06023177}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05089512675303, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.36180993, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01964127}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:55:47.374Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
