{"data": {"id": 7048, "name": "Wing", "symbol": "WING", "slug": "wing", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Wing (WING)?\n\nWing is a credit-based, decentralized platform designed for crypto-asset lending and cross-chain communication between decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) projects. The project aims to make crypto lending services more inclusive through a credit evaluation module that removes the need for large collaterals. Wing is a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao)) that allows users to take part in decision-making, product design and operations.\n\nWing uses decentralized governance coupled with a risk control mechanism to improve the relationships between creditors, borrowers and guarantors. This has led to an improvement in the number of and accessibility to DeFi projects utilizing the platform. One of the goals of Wing DAO is to solve the issue of over-collateralization that plagues the DeFi industry.\n\nThe platform allows for the creation of new blockchain projects and focuses its efforts on a [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) and autonomous governing community. In response to the issues faced by other DeFi projects, Wing DAO has built a credit-based DeFi protocol that runs on the Ontology ([ONT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology/)) blockchain. The protocol is fully controlled by the users and requires no third parties to confirm transactions.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Wing?\n\nWing is the credit-based cross-chain DeFi platform developed and operated by the Ontology team.\n\n\n#### What Makes Wing Unique?\n\nOne unique feature of Wing is that it allows users to set up a DAO proposal or become an investor on the platform even without prior knowledge or interaction with the blockchain. Wing offers project developers a chance to receive crowdfunding when they submit proposals. Investors have the opportunity to contribute to decision-making and in return earn a share of future profits through smart contracts. \n\nWing is built on the Ontology blockchain due to its ability to create collateral pools across different blockchains. Ontology enables the digitization of new and existing assets. \n\nThe blockchain also has a feature called OScore, which is a credit-scoring system. OScore evaluates the lending/borrowing history and digital asset information of the users. Users on the platform have full control over their accounts and can access their OScore securely to ensure data privacy. \n\nIn addition, since borrowers have to rely on their OScore data for loans, the collateral required to make loans on the platform is reduced. In Wing\u2019s inclusive pool, users are incentivized to keep a good credit score. Users who repay their loans on time may enjoy lowered interest rates on their loans. Some DeFi platforms similar to Wing include [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap) and [AAVE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/).\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps).\n\nLearn more about [Bitcoin wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-wallet).\n\nImprove your crypto knowledge with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Wing (WING) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe WING token has a circulating supply of 976,314 tokens as of February 2021 and a total supply of 2,484,052. WING is the governance token of the platform\u2019s DAO, and as such it confers voting rights on its holders.\n\nWing launched its initial coin offerings (ICOs) between November 2016 and January 2017 and was able to raise $1.7 million in funding.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Wing (WING)?\n\nThe WING token can be bought on several exchanges, including:\n\n\n\n*
