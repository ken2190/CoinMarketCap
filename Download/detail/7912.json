{"data": {"id": 7912, "name": "USD stable+ coin", "symbol": "IUSD", "slug": "usd-stableplus-coin", "category": "coin", "description": "## What is IUSD?\n\nIUSD is a novel type of stablecoin that is issued on a two-dimensional bonding curve. \n\nIt is pegged to USD plus interest -- the coin grows as it accrues interest, it is a stable+ coin.\n\n## Who is it for?\n\nIUSD is meant for investors seeking predictable income in USD.\n\n## What are the benefits?\n\nThere is no overcollateralization when issuing IUSD and no risk of liquidations. \n\nThe coin runs on a DAG, not a blockchain, hence there is no risk of front-running and miner manipulation.\n\n\n## How Many IUSD Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nIUSD started with 0 supply on September 22, 2020. Given its status as a stablecoin, the supply is uncapped, and can expand or shrink according to demand. IUSD tokens are only issued against [GBYTE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/obyte/) reserves and the total supply of GBYTE is limited.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of IUSD?\n\nIUSD was developed by [Obyte](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/obyte/) team, which maintains the open-source code of Obyte network -- one of the first DAG based networks running since 2016 and the first DAG to support Dapps. The team has developed several unique products such as textcoins (which allow sending cryptocurrency to email), self-sovereign identity, untraceable currency blackbytes, and many others.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy or Redeem IUSD?\n\nYou can buy IUSD in [Bonded Stablecoins Dapp](https://ostable.org). You can also redeem IUSD for GBYTE on the same website.", "dateAdded": "2020-12-08T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "6", "dateLaunched": "2020-09-21T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://ostable.org"], "technical_doc": ["https://medium.com/obyte/using-multi-dimensional-bonding-curves-to-create-stablecoins-81e857b4355c"], "explorer": ["https://explorer.obyte.org/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/byteball/bonded-stablecoin"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/obyte"], "chat": ["https://discord.obyte.org", "https://t.me/obyteorg"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/obyte"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/ObyteOrg"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.3612195944546, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.17601351, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.88343741}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.18921099005988, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.51699415, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.73821455}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04643961244019, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.73678066, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.27032434}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36150489443973, "priceChangePercentage24h": 19.04359337, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.91891534}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08923299177811, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.13388567, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.32644123}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.37066222076509, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.82115157, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.57259827}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.59324173267264, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.40116572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.41037007}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12853834341231, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.49322954, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.50599815}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0508112068182, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.59825653, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.24542066}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:23:58.242Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "28", "credit_count": 0}}
