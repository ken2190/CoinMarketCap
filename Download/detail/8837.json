The Scholarship Foundation will participate in the mining process to gradually build its treasury. The treasury will be used to back another coin which will be a Scholarship Stable Coin SCHOUSD which will be worth 1$ USD. Once the stable coin is launch, it will be used to operate the Scholarship Foundation System. Additionally, on top of continuous mining of the SCHO, the Scholarship Coin Foundation will purchase more SCHO. The foundation will use 50% of the minted stable coins to reinvest in the foundation by purchasing SCHO. The purchase of SCHO will occur one time period every month. The Foundation will continue mining and purchasing SCHO until its treasury holds 10 million SCHO. The remaining 10 million SCHO will remain in circulation forever.\nWho Are the Founders of the Scholarship Coin?\n\nThe Scholarship Coin and its economic scholarship system was designed and created by the World Scholarship Foundation, a non-profit organisation that is managing the continued support of the Scholarship Coin infrastructure and Scholarship rewarding system which will operate with its stable coin (SCHOUSD).\n\nThe founders of the project have a good understanding of cryptocurrency economics. Their strong points are project management, programming, development and strategic communications. \n\nThis initiative paves the way as the first official charitable cryptocurrency project. It is an opportunity to demonstrate real case usage of blockchain technology to leverage social development and wealth. The foundation aims to demonstrate the true benefits of cryptocurrencies for society by tackling the issues which revolve around access to proper education, an area that needs strong support across the world. \n\nThe main objective of this project is to demonstrate how cryptocurrency can power social infrastructures and contribute to a positive evolution factor for humanity.\n\nWhere Can I Buy Scholarship Coin (SCHO)?\n\nSCHO is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges:\n\n\nUseful Links:\nWebsite: www.scholarshipcoin.org\nWhitepaper: https://scholarshipcoin.org/files/ScholarshipCoin_Wahitepaper_V1.pdf\n\nMining Pools: \n\u2022\tNOMP: http://pool2.scholarshipcoin.org/\n\u2022\tYIIMP: https://pool.scholarshipcoin.org/\n\nGroups and Social Pages:\n-Medium: https://medium.com/@scholarshipcoin\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/CoinScholarship\n-Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholarship_Coin/\n-GitHub: https://github.com/scholarshipcoin\n-Discord: https://discord.gg/Xt28253Caf", "dateAdded": "2021-03-16T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:30:08.000Z", "watchCount": "383", "dateLaunched": "2021-02-17T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.scholarshipcoin.org", "https://worldscholarshipfoundation.com"], "technical_doc": ["https://scholarshipcoin.org/files/ScholarshipCoin_Wahitepaper_V1.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://explorer.scholarshipcoin.org/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/scholarshipcoin/scholarshipcoin"], "message_board": ["https://discord.gg/Xt28253Ca", "https://medium.com/@scholarshipcoin"], "chat": ["https://discord.gg/Xt28253Ca"], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5318581.0"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/Scholarship_Coin"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/CoinScholarship"]}, "volume": 115.71048936, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "statistics": {"price": 0.01369475029814, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.13086597, "priceChangePercentage24h": 171.51414828, "priceChangePercentage7d": 362.31369839, "priceChangePercentage30d": 364.46226735, "priceChangePercentage60d": 51.75664147, "priceChangePercentage90d": -32.64367763, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 273895.01, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 33.78, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 20000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4861, "low24h": 0.00504384, "high24h": 0.01374237, "low7d": 0.00463875, "high7d": 0.01374237, "low30d": 0.00264645, "high30d": 0.01374237, "low90d": 0.00210026, "high90d": 0.03318559, "low52w": 0.00210026, "high52w": 3.50010137, "lowAllTime": 0.00210026, "highAllTime": 3.50010137, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 552.05, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -99.61, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-22T14:32:06.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-03-21T16:12:07.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00504384, "highYesterday": 0.01364542, "openYesterday": 0.0051581, "closeYesterday": 0.01362249, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 164.1, "volumeYesterday": 116.09, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.10734945164149, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.3258385, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.07822279}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.20228456848141, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.01863901, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.8715583}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04646938435769, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.59242332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.13094411}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34819853481682, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.69811924, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.29735003}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08917632064107, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.856402, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.12439624}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34449767575729, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.37764688, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.10600251}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.59340021063595, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.79388358, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.28813508}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12833740050694, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.57892734, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.12853881}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04992025559031, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.2087894, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.72992738}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:30:34.525Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
