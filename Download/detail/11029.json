The aim of the project is to bring together cryptocurrency investors and art lovers on the same platform, to ensure investment in tokenized artworks. First-class fine art pieces insured in line with the transparent pricing of art experts from various countries are tokenized on the blockchain in return for their insurance value. With the smart contract technology used, you can buy and sell the tokens, the supply of which is fixed, both in the pre-sale process and in the quantities you want from the works listed on the market. The working model of Artex, which has been meticulously designed in line with the views of investors, artists, auctions, and galleries and within the framework of common interests; promises to provide the liquidity, security, transparency, and easy access the sector needs by paving the way for democracy in art investments. \n\nWe believe in a world where not only the lucky and privileged few, but everyone can invest in first-class artworks. Blockchain is the safest way to achieve this, and our vision is to provide the necessary products and services with great transparency to ensure that investing in artworks becomes the new trend of the crypto world. The future of finance is a democratic distribution. Power is in everyone's hands.\n\nARTEX is the native utility token that is used for:\n\n- Production and approval of smart contracts,\n- Participating in the pre-sale,\n- Lower commission fees,\n- Participating in auctions and bidding, \n- Artex Tokens will be used for the function and shopping transactions of all privileged functions of the platform such as participating in international
