{"data": {"id": 5072, "name": "Rakon", "symbol": "RKN", "slug": "rakon", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Rakon (RKN)?\n\nRakon is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based network that is designed to connect infrastructure, satellites and navigation and communication systems in trustless ecosystems that do not depend on middlemen or intermediaries. The network uses smart contracts to power frequency control and timing solutions for devices such as wireless controls, smart power grids, aviation systems and other applications. According to its white paper, the [vision](https://rkntoken.io/Rakon_Whitepaper.pdf) of Rakon is to \"enable transparent information flow and efficient collaboration.\"\n\nRKN is the token that powers the activities of the Rakon ecosystem. It is used as \"fuel\" to execute the smart contracts that operate on its network.\n\nRakon is expected to [launch](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/brand-connect/orbit-network-ventures-into-the-telecommunication-industry-with-its-exclusive-asset-called-rkn-token/61459/1) in the fourth quarter of 2020. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Rakon?\n\nRakon was created by Orbit Network Inc. through its subsidiary Blockchain Development Inc. The project was first conceived in the third quarter of 2018, and it is expected to officially launch in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nOrbit Network develops products that use blockchain technology and smart contracts, with the intention of increasing usability and driving global enterprise blockchain adoption. The company is behind other [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) projects, including [Sports and Leisure](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sport-and-leisure/) (SNL), a token pegged to [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) and designed to connect the traditional and digital sports and leisure industries, and [New York Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/newyork-exchange/) (NYE), which seeks to bridge traditional stock and commodity trading with cryptocurrency trading.\n\nOrbit Network also operates [Orbitex](https://www.orbitnetwork.net/orbit-trading), a platform for trading both traditional and crypto assets.\n\n\n#### What Makes Rakon Unique?\n\nRakon is focused on integrating blockchain-based, smart contract systems into industries that rely on highly advanced emerging technologies. Its revenue model is [centered around](https://medium.com/@rakontoken/rakon-revenue-model-493944559eb4) establishing itself as a go-to solution for fields of global positioning systems \u2014 otherwise known as GPS \u2014 telecommunications, defense, space, the Internet of Things and others. It is particularly focused on integrating smart contracts into frequency control and timing solutions.\n\nFollowing its launch, Rakon's first use case is expected to be in the telecommunications sector, with Orbit Network [announcing](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/brand-connect/orbit-network-ventures-into-the-telecommunication-industry-with-its-exclusive-asset-called-rkn-token/61459/1) in August 2020 that it will be partnering with firms in the United States, Canada, India, Turkey and the United Kingdom to allow users to top up their mobile phones using RKN. The company also stated that RKN will serve as the exclusive asset of its Orbit Network Chain Server.\n\nRakon also [anticipates](https://medium.com/@rakontoken/who-is-going-to-use-rkn-token-1ae58427f411) that cryptocurrency investors will see RKN as having growth potential, further supporting the project through their purchasing decisions.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn about [Sports and Leisure](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sport-and-leisure/), a cryptocurrency developed by the same team behind Rakon. \n\nLearn about [Telcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/telcoin/), another cryptocurrency seeking to change the telecommunications industry.\n\nCurious how crypto ICOs take place? Read an [in-depth guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-an-ico) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on the ways crypto and blockchain are changing industries with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Rakon (RKN) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nRakon has a fixed maximum supply of 285,714,286 tokens. RKN was first made available for purchase through an [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) that began in April 2019, during which ETH could be exchanged for RKN \u2014 with a minimum transaction amount of 1 ETH. The project has also stated that users will be able to earn RKN by promoting it on social media and other internet platforms.\n\nAccording to its white paper, Rakon has an 85% token distribution plan, which will be featured in an updated white paper, and network fees will be distributed to RKN tokenholders on a pro rata basis each quarter.\n\n\n### How Is the Rakon Network Secured?\n\nRKN is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token. Therefore, Rakon relies on the Ethereum blockchain network to verify and process its transactions. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm, meaning that miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nWhile RKN transactions themselves are secured by the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, the token's ERC-20 contract on Ethereum is controlled by its issuer. Thus, the security of user funds is also the responsibility of Rakon's founding company, Orbit Network. The company's website [states](https://www.orbitnetwork.net/security-of-fund) that it completes its due diligence and follows strict protocols to keep its information systems secure.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Rakon (RKN)?\n\nRakon is listed on a few smaller cryptocurrency exchanges \u2014 including [Cat.Ex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/catex/), [CREX24](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/crex24/), [ProBit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/probit-exchange/) and [STEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/stex/) \u2014 where it is available to be traded against ETH and the [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT).\n\nAre you interested in buying RKN or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC)? CoinMarketCap has a simple, [step-by-step guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to teach you all about crypto and how to buy your first coins.", "dateAdded":
