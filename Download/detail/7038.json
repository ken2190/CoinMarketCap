{"data": {"id": 7038, "name": "Xfinance", "symbol": "XFI", "slug": "xfinance", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Xfinance Coin (XFI)?\n\n[Xfinance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xfinance/) (XFI) is full-stack [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) protocol that revolutionizes the sector\u2019s existing functionalities tied to [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool), market-making and trading.\n\nThe XFI protocol uses the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) to power a [full-stack](https://xfinance.io/) product. Therefore, the platform isn\u2019t limited to a single product. For example, it\u2019s ideal for token swaps, leverage trading, and trading of non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token)).\n\nThe DeFi protocol has a mobile app that lowers barriers to access DeFi products, requiring only a smartphone and a stable internet connection. A new version of Xfinance was [released](https://nowex.medium.com/major-update-of-xfinance-xfi-project-e6523cd334b8) at the end of August 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Xfinance?\n\nApart from a line on its Medium page description stating that it is \u201cbuilt by NowEx.io,\u201d there is no detailed [information](https://xangle.io/project/report/XFI/en) on the project\u2019s team members. However, it has struck partnerships with notable platforms such as [LID](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/liquidity-dividends-protocol/) (Liquidity Dividends Protocol), which offers high-end solutions in providing [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) on DeFi networks, and [DEX Tools](https://www.dextools.io/), which focuses on improving users\u2019 experience of crypto trading platforms. \n\nAdditionally, the protocol has links with [NowEx](https://nowex.medium.com/why-choose-nowex-cryptos-fastest-growing-derivatives-exchange-ae825932d85), a derivatives exchange.\n\n\n#### What Makes Xfinance Unique?\n\n[Xfinance](https://xfinance.io/) claims to bring a new dimension to the Ethereum DeFi industry as a full-stack network that is not limited to only one product, which opens it up to many more use cases in the ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the network supports NFT trading through its xNFT feature. In addition, its xPerp offering allows the trading of perpetual contracts. XSwap is another Xfinance product handling [automatic market-making](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) (AMM).\n\nThe protocol\u2019s use of [transaction fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transaction-fee) from its various products is among the few firsts in the DeFi space. Transaction fees from the xNFT and xPerp features go to buying back and burning the platform\u2019s native currency, XFI.\n\nXfinance supports many coins and rewards both parties interacting with [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool), i.e., borrowers and lenders.\n\nThe Xfinance mobile application makes it easy for anyone to interact with the DeFi ecosystem. The protocol\u2019s revenues come from fees charged on different products such as[ XSwap](https://nowex.medium.com/xswap-farm-now-is-live-c799861c10eb) and activities such as [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and [unstaking](https://nowex.medium.com/xfi-staking-dapp-now-is-live-95f3312df4a9). The protocol also aims to unlock the full value of the Xfinance ecosystem by buying back and burning XFI tokens claimed as trading fees. \n\nFinally, the XFI token supply is also fixed, thereby offering a non-inflationary and limited supply of XFI tokens. \n\n\n### What Products and Services Do Xfinance Offer?\n\n\n\n1. xDao: A decentralized community governance platform.\n2. xNFT: Consists of NFT (non-fungible token) trading protocol and asset trading platform where transaction fees are used to buy back and burn XFI.\n3. xPerp: A decentralized AMM (automated market making) perpetual contract exchange, where transaction fees are used to buy back and burn XFI.\n4. xSwap: A decentralized AMM protocol and exchange, with an XSP platform token. xSwap promises a completely fair yield farming where no funds are allocated to developer funds or team shares. \n5. xVault: A decentralized common asset income and yield aggregator vault that automatically moves positions between agreements to help liquidity providers gain the most financial income. XVault withdrawal fees will be used to buy back and burn XFI.\n6. Staking: The protocol offers Incentivized staking that targets long-term holders, with daily staking APR ranging between 0.2% - 0.3%.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Uniswap (UNI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/).\n\nLearn more about [FTX Token (FTT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/).\n\nLearn more about [dYdX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/dydx/).\n\nCheck out the [CMC blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Xfinance Coins (XFI) Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe protocol was launched in September 2020 in collaboration with LID to conduct an XFI initial launch presale. The sale involved exchanging the native token for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) at a rate of 1 ETH for [3.8 XFI](https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-project-xfinance-7615.htm) coins when trading on [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap/).\n\nA 60% allocation of the [proceeds](https://news.bitcoin.com/new-defi-project-xfinancexfi-ilo-presale-will-start-today/) went to providing liquidity on Uniswap, while 15% went to buying back and burning the network\u2019s base asset. Notably, the buyback option was meant to reduce the supply and boost the value by increasing the coin\u2019s demand.\n\nThe [max supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/max-supply) of the native currency is capped at 50,000. The presale event subtracted 30% (15,000) of the supply. The team accounts for [29%](https://cryptoadventure.org/xfinance-review-defi-trading-platform/) XFI tokens while 21% goes to the ecosystem fund, and 5% was set aside for listing, developments, marketing, and airdrop.\n\nThe team\u2019s token allocation has a 10-months [unlock period](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/timelock-locktime) where ten percent is unlocked every 30 days.\n\nXfinance uses the base currency to power a host of services and rewards on the platform. To elaborate, it can be used to pay for transaction charges, receive rewards for liquidity providers, and staking.\n\nDaily staking rewards vary between 0.2% and 0.3%. XFI staking took off in September 2020, and 1,050 XFI coins from the ecosystem fund were marked to provide rewards to stakers. Furthermore, the platform [charges](https://nowex.medium.com/xfi-staking-dapp-now-is-live-95f3312df4a9) a flat rate of 2.5% for every stake or unstake event.\n\n\n### How Is the Xfinance Network Secured?\n\nThe protocol runs on the Ethereum blockchain, the second-largest blockchain platform, which currently uses the dual consensus mechanism [(proof of work and proof of stake)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hybrid-pow-pos). Furthermore, its native token, XFI, is built using Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standards. As such, being an Ethereum-based token means that XFinance sits on tried-and-tested technology.\n\nThe token can be stored on all major cryptocurrency wallets supporting ERC-20-based currencies. This includes TrustWallet and hardware wallets.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Xfinance Coin (XFI)?\n\nXFI is [listed](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xfinance/) on various platforms, including [ProBit Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/probit-exchange/), [DigiFinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/digifinex/), [Bibox](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bibox/), [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap/), [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/) and [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/). Its major pairs include ETH, [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT), Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).
