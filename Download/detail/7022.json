{"data": {"id": 7022, "name": "Pickle Finance", "symbol": "PICKLE", "slug": "pickle-finance", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Pickle Finance (PICKLE)?\n\nPickle Finance is a [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) yield farming protocol built on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). It was launched with the intention of helping to stabilize the one-to-one peg of stablecoins \u2014 such as [Dai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) (DAI), [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT), [USD Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) (USDC) and [sUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/susd/) (SUSD) \u2014 by incentivizing participants to sell above-peg stablecoins and purchase below-peg ones.\n\nPickle Finance is powered by a native [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, PICKLE, that is used for governance and as a reward for [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider).\n\nThe project appears to have been [teased](https://twitter.com/picklefinance/status/1296107139883323392) in August 2020 before officially [launching](https://picklefinance.medium.com/pickle-finance-launch-beea2eb8eacb) in September 2020. In November 2020, Pickle Finance began the process of [integrating](https://medium.com/iearn/pickle-yearn-ferment-co-operation-dill-eec43b93d0ea) with [yearn.finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/) (YFI).\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Pickle Finance?\n\nPickle Finance was founded by four pseudonymous developers who are primarily represented by an individual known as \"Larry the Cucumber\" \u2014 a reference to a character from the religious cartoon Veggie Tales. One of the other developers, \"Rick,\" left the project early on, while the other two developers, \"0xPenguin\" and \"BigBrainBriner,\" [stepped away](https://twitter.com/picklefinance/status/1337866272143364097) in December 2020.\n\nLarry the Cucumber has [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktl9sLYNiJc) that he has previous experience in web development and Android mobile app development. His first exposure to crypto was in 2015 when his friend BigBrainBriner introduced him to Ethereum, and he later started to experiment with developing Solidity-based projects. He first realized the potential of decentralized finance with the success of the Maker Protocol.\n\nAfter 0xPenguin and BigBrainBriner left the project, another pseudonymous developer, \"0xkoffee77,\" was [brought on](https://twitter.com/picklefinance/status/1337866270914478080). 0xkoffee77 is a full-stack blockchain developer who had three years of previous experience in the cryptosphere.\n\n\n#### What Makes Pickle Finance Unique?\n\nAccording to its \"PicoPaper,\" Pickle Finance is [distinct](https://picklefinance.medium.com/pickle-picopaper-46370d2a4a75) from other [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) projects because it offers a service to the community \u2014 the ability to stabilize [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) pegs, although the project has since expanded beyond this function \u2014 while other projects \"don\u2019t actually do anything.\"\n\nThe project uses an incentive mechanism to help maintain the pegs, giving rewards in the form of PICKLE to those who provide [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) to its stablecoin-[Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) pools. The incentive mechanism provides higher rewards for participating in a [pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) for an under-pegged stablecoin. Users can also send tokens to \"[PickleJars](https://picklefinance.medium.com/introducing-picklejars-70a311ab65c5),\" or pJars \u2014 vaults that use alpha-seeking strategies to generate returns that are returned to the pool, causing the total value of the deposit to increase.\n\nThe Pickle Jar development team has sought to spread awareness of the project through community outreach, including [hosting](https://picklefinance.medium.com/pickle-community-creative-challenge-10-000-in-awards-to-top-20-contributors-43604dcbf224) a \"Pickle Community Creative Challenge\" in which prizes were given to participants for the best pickle-related creative pieces, such as drawings or music. In November 2020, it announced that it would be joining with yearn.finance in an agreement under which its pJars will be integrated into yearn.finance's yVaults, with the Pickle Finance development team receiving a 10% performance fee for writing strategies.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [yearn.finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/), another yield farming protocol, with which Pickle Finance has agreed to integrate.\n\nLearn about [Ethereum Yield](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-yield/), a yield farming protocol with a price-pumping strategy.\n\nWant to learn more about yield farming? Read an [in-depth guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on the latest developments in the DeFi sector with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Pickle Finance (PICKLE) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nPickle Finance does not have a maximum token supply. New PICKLE is minted with each Ethereum block in a rapidly [decreasing](https://snapshot.page/#/pickle/proposal/QmcEsb4oUBtYbPRk6hTFNzhBRFFs6M7FtRVgRfRAWFzXAn) pattern, with 1 PICKLE per block minted with each block after four weeks.\n\nThe project neither premined tokens nor held an [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico), and it has said that it did not receive venture capital investment.\n\nIn December 2020, Pickle Finance [announced](https://picklefinance.medium.com/into-the-brine-vol-4-yearn-collab-and-smart-treasury-65a30a1a2380) that it would soon release its \"Smart Treasury\" that will automatically buy back PICKLE with revenue from fees, act as a liquidity provider and generate trading fees, and issue PICKLE to be used for things such as grants.\n\n\n### How Is the Pickle Finance Network Secured?\n\nPickle Finance uses an ERC-20 token, which means that PICKLE transactions are validated by the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nPickle Finance's strategies were [audited](https://twitter.com/picklefinance/status/1324242273245122565) by blockchain security firm MixBites, and the complete protocol was [audited](https://twitter.com/picklefinance/status/1328747488023441408) by Haechi Audit, which found no major security vulnerabilities. However, in November 2020, Pickle Finance was [hacked](https://picklefinance.medium.com/pickle-was-hacked-and-there-has-been-a-loss-of-funds-414b99969c29), and nearly 20 million DAI was stolen. Haechi Audit [clarified](https://twitter.com/haechi_audit/status/1330347468802973698) that the attack was carried out against a newly created [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), not one that had been audited by the firm.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Pickle Finance (PICKLE)?\n\nPICKLE is primarily exchanged on [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), although it is also listed on [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/), [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/) and others. It can be traded against [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) (WETH), [Aave](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/) (AAVE) and [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether) (USDT).\n\nAre you interested in buying PICKLE or other [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC)? CoinMarketCap has a simple, [step-by-step guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to teach you all about crypto and how to buy your first coins.\n", "dateAdded":
