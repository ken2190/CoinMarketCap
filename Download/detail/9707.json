{"data": {"id": 9707, "name": "Zazinga DAO", "symbol": "ZAZINGA", "slug": "zazinga-dao", "category": "token", "description": "Built on Binance Smart Chain for diamond hand holders with a clear focus on simplifying the concept of reflection and liquidity. Zazinga DAO is a protocol everyone can understand and use.\r\n\r\n3% of every transaction is locked as liquidity in the Pancakeswap ZAZINGA/BNB pool forever creating an ever rising price floor.\r\n\r\n3% of every transaction is redistributed back to ZAZINGA holders in proportion to their holdings! 50% of the supply has been sent to the Burn address at launch. Because the amount is so massive, it will absorb a significant amount of the 3% tax distribution, resulting in exponential hyperdeflation!\r\n\r\nWe're building something that we believe to be really cool, unique, fun and rewarding for all ZAZINGA holders\r\n\r\n1. We will launch NFT store on our website, it has custom made ZAZINGA characters that can only be purchased with ZAZINGA token. All ZAZINGA that is used to purhase these NFTs will be burned.\r\n\r\n2. These characters are very basic (tier 1), and will have low stats (explained later). They can however be evolved by staking them in special staking events, increasing their stats (original NFT burned, new one with better stats minted)\r\n\r\n3. All characters will have different stats (metadata). For now we have few in mind, for example; Intellect (what kind of work can this character do), Speed (how fast can it work), Strength (how long can it work until needing a break). These are subject to change and there will be more stats implemented as we go forward.\r\n\r\n4. All characters, even tier 1 that were purchased from NFT store without evolving them, can be used in special NFT staking pools to make them work for you (we call these ZAZINGA mines!). What kind of pools, how fast you receive rewards and how long can you stake your NFT will depend on the stats of the character. We will collaborate with as many other projects as we can to diversify rewards gained from our NFT staking.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-11T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "0", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-23T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.zazin.ga"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x4e37353778387a27de70f97b264715eedf9cfcd7"], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/@ZazingaDAO"], "chat": ["https://t.me/zazinga_dao"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/zazingadao"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.14770510434796, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.12304848, "priceChangePercentage7d": 53.83680601}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.08948521717125, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.05496242, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50256086}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0463266287478, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13415688, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.4756861}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34158907038751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.96859664, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.45374901}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08827561295395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.52347736, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.42732901}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33218429865312, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.34412525, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.45266776}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.65780294191658, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.60956613, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.69376176}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12744789978998, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.21786754, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.8643341}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04507747416068, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.01797293, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.73429399}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:36:46.200Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
