It\u2019s automatically sent to the wallets throughout the day. \n\nBUSD Smart distribution: For the first time ever, the holders don\u2019t need to buy tokens to be able to receive their rewarded tokens on their wallets. \n\nThere is a 15% tax on all buys 10% BUSD REWARDS , 5% goes to Auto-liqudity and a 21% tax on sells 14% BUSD REWARDS with 7% going to Auto-liqudity. \n\nSecured By Design: Initial liquidity is locked with DXSALE for more than 10 years.\n\n\nSmart distribution mechanism: - The contract keeps track in an array of all token holders. - The contract keeps an index into the array for processing. - Every transaction processes a certain number of users, depending on the transaction size (bigger token transfers can process more, since the gas will still be proportionally less than the value of the tokens). -The token is based on a Dividend-Paying Token Standard, which means all BUSD the contract gains will be split equally proportionally to the token holders. -When a user is processed, the contract checks how many withdrawable dividends they have, and if it is above the minimum threshold for auto-claims, will either automatically claim those dividends for BUSD, or automatically buy back tokens for them. -This system is fully automated and doesn't add minimal gas fees proportional to value transferred. -The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size. -Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the array. It's a fair system, fully automated.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:54:37.000Z", "watchCount": "9411", "dateLaunched": "2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["http://www.babybusd.net/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xa22dc6babab39c2d83f0d4b174ef7016424253a7"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/Babybusdbsc"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/BabyBusd"]}, "volume": 87236.62895149, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -1.1362, "statistics": {"price": 1.103919277e-05, "priceChangePercentage1h": 1.28016134, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.1369262, "priceChangePercentage7d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage30d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 1103919.28, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 100000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 3459, "low24h": 8.7e-06, "high24h": 1.106e-05, "low7d": 6.55e-06, "high7d": 1.658e-05, "low30d": 6.55e-06, "high30d": 1.658e-05, "low90d": 6.55e-06, "high90d": 1.658e-05, "low52w": 6.55e-06, "high52w": 1.658e-05, "lowAllTime": 6.55e-06, "highAllTime": 1.658e-05, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 68.54, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -33.42, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-30T08:48:17.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-28T04:11:08.000Z", "lowYesterday": 6.55e-06, "highYesterday": 9.92e-06, "openYesterday": 8.75e-06, "closeYesterday": 9.77e-06, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 11.66, "volumeYesterday": 112676.8, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xa22dc6babab39c2d83f0d4b174ef7016424253a7", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xa22dc6babab39c2d83f0d4b174ef7016424253a7", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.15277603529009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97491332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.15383074}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.34964051346751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.48864478, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65721962}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04606059556592, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.60454635, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.52026324}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35073162374456, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.29500189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.00533147}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08805508567185, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49406181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.66853882}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33953608915345, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.35932698, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.52614735}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.81208358366918, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.33740637, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.63805644}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884983830176, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.8379087, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.06023177}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05089512675303, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.36180993, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01964127}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:56:27.669Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
