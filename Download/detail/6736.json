Its main goal was to create a platform where people and businesses interested in renewable energy and electric mobility, be able to contact each other and establish long term collaboration. In 2018 VOLTPOT\u00ae launched a web portal on the market for renewable energy and electric mobility sectors: https://voltpot.com. One of its main features is to give those people who produce their own energy (e.g. solar panels) a way to share the energy excess with others (e.g. electric cars drivers). A system of Volt-Points was integrated within the platform to serve this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 2020 VOLTPOT\u00ae ltd. decided to implement another way to help people and businesses to trade their renewable energy excess: a dedicated Blockchain-based crypto-currency. In August 2020, the VoltPotCoin (VPC) was launched.", "dateAdded": "2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "30", "dateLaunched": "2020-08-26T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [{"slug": "energy", "name": "Energy", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://voltpot.org"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://explorer.voltpot.org"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/ekkakon/vpc"], "message_board": [], "chat": [], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/voltpot"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.85772503734395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 40.30756529, "priceChangePercentage7d": 57.90745062}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.29499070066937, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.52326861, "priceChangePercentage7d": 21.67542856}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04647355788614, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.57682717, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.43140837}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36656520586486, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.09072449, "priceChangePercentage7d": 27.22323593}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08980153241338, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.56349231, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.02438398}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.39082136530065, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.02278986, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.75426601}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.57970010316956, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.61993043, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.51452389}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12842553254554, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.43732251, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.71042985}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05648541496579, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.73343012, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.22292281}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:15:44.561Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
