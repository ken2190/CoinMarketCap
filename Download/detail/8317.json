On the other hand, in order to unleash the full potential of such new business models comprehensive and commercial-grade settlement layer and data layer need to be put in place. \n\nIt confirms our strategy to start with pushing the adoption in non-financial real world use cases and enable financial institutions and central banks to build the infrastructure and financial products using NakerDAO\u2019s blockchain technologies.NakerDAO helps to connect different companies in the ecosystem to reach a mutually beneficial partnership that also incentivizes the end consumers. \n\nSome may have concerns for data privacy issue, and this has been on our minds since day one. The easy solution is to obtain consent from the data owner before it is used by another party. On top of that, we are also working out privacy solutions such as multi-party computation (MPC) to further address this issue that many have concerns for. All of the above are cornerstones of the robust distributed business ecosystem that is envisioned by NakerDAO.", "dateAdded": "2021-01-25T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "22", "dateLaunched": "2020-11-18T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://info.nakerdao.com/"], "technical_doc": ["https://info.nakerdao.com/whitepaper.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0x597910a47067fced9e48286d39744b2b6d2cf913", "https://ethplorer.io/address/0x597910a47067fced9e48286d39744b2b6d2cf913"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["http://t.me/NakerDAO_Community"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/NakerNkr?s=09"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0x597910a47067fced9e48286d39744b2b6d2cf913", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0x597910a47067fced9e48286d39744b2b6d2cf913", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.03134700774729, "priceChangePercentage24h": 38.740772, "priceChangePercentage7d": 54.85811015}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.17988634190226, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.61080351, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.68001587}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04639854764364, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.98227793, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.98375188}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.33725852668137, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.62068265, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.54980298}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08918255131581, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.35599288, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.18401814}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3525015594285, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.77242423, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.34447687}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.58966416129965, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13094619, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.03612006}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12852564418261, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.36000344, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.48719062}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0493080904636, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.55968162, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.11264119}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:26:50.845Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "17", "credit_count": 0}}
