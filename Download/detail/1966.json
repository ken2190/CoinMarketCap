{"data": {"id": 1966, "name": "Decentraland", "symbol": "MANA", "slug": "decentraland", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Decentraland (MANA)?\n\nDecentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications. \n\nIn this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon and monetize. \n\nDecentraland was launched following a $24 million initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) that was conducted in 2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020. Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences. \n\nDecentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Decentraland?\n\nDecentraland was co-founded by Ariel Meilich and Esteban Ordano \u2014 both of whom have stepped down from major positions at the project, but still work alongside Decentraland as advisors. \n\nAriel Meilich previously held the role of project lead at Decentraland between 2017 and 2020, and is a serial entrepreneur that has founded several other startups, including an online translation agency and a CRM platform. He also worked as an analyst at Charles River Ventures, a prominent Silicon Valley venture fund. \n\nOn the other hand, Esteban Ordano is Decentraland's former tech lead and has a long and varied history in the cryptocurrency space working as a software engineer at BitPay, Inc., an advisor to [Matic Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/matic-network/) and briefly operated his own smart contract development firm known as Smart Contract Solutions. \n\nEsteban is also credited with co-founding Zeppelin Solutions, an established blockchain technology infrastructure company. \n\nAlthough Ariel and Estaban are no longer leading the project, the development of Decentraland is still ongoing, with efforts being directed by the recently established Decentraland Foundation. \n\n\n#### What Makes Decentraland Unique?\n\nDecentraland is built for content creators, businesses and individuals that are looking for a new artistic medium, business opportunity, or source of entertainment.\n\nIn total, the Decentraland gameworld \u2014 termed the \u201cMetaverse\u201d \u2014 is divided into 90,601 individual parcels of LAND, each of which is represented by an [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) non-fungible token. Each LAND is exactly 16m x 16m (256 square meters) and can be found at a particular coordinate in the Metaverse. \n\nThough LAND holders are free to develop their plot into whatever they choose, much of the Metaverse is broadly divided into several districts, each of which has a different size and theme. These districts were generated through individual crowdsales for MANA tokens, and parcels of LAND in these districts cannot be traded. \n\nAs of January 2021, the cyberpunk-themed Aetheria is the largest district \u2014 comprising a total of 8,008 LAND. \n\nDecentraland is also one of the growing number of projects to use a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) structure for governance decisions. As a result, MANA toker holders are in control of how the Decentraland world behaves, by proposing and voting on policy updates, the specifics of upcoming LAND auctions and the types of content that are allowed with the Metaverse.\n\nBesides being a creative outlet, many Decentraland users currently monetize their LAND through leasing, advertising and paid experiences. Likewise, other users generate an income by creating and selling items on the Decentraland marketplace for MANA tokens. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [AnRKey X (ANRX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/anrkey-x/) \u2014 the first game to merge [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance), e-sports, and Web 3.0.\n\nCheck out [Axie Infinity (AXS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axie-infinity/) \u2014 a digital pet universe and decentralized trading game.\n\nLearn more about non-fungible tokens with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token#:~:text=Non%2Dfungible%20tokens%20(NFTs),possess%20the%20property%20of%20fungibility.)\n\nGet the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Decentraland (MANA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of January 2021, just north of 1.49 billion MANA tokens were in circulation. This is equivalent to around 68% of the current total supply of 2.19 billion MANA. \n\nThe original total supply was set at 2.8 billion MANA, but has been reduced as more than 600 million MANA have been burned as a result of LAND auctions. \n\nThere is also a range of further burn mechanisms in place to further reduce the circulating supply of MANA, including a 2.5% MANA burn on Decentraland marketplace transactions. \n\nMANA was originally designed to inflate at 8 percent in the first year, decreasing gradually over time to reduce the rate of inflation. But inflation is currently disabled. As per the [Decentraland glossary](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/glossary/), there are no plans to initiate this inflation \"until necessary\".\n\nIn total, 40% of the MANA supply was sold during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). In addition, 20% was reserved to incentivize the community, 20% went to the development team and other early contributors, and the remaining 20% was held by Decentraland. Project lead tokens are no longer vested. \n\n\n### How Is the Decentraland Network Secured?\n\nMANA is an ERC-20 token. This means it is based on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\n\nEthereum is secured by a massive decentralized network of miners, which work together with thousands of nodes to ensure the Ethereum blockchain\u2014and hence the MANA tokens\u2014is protected against [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack). \n\nAs one of the most battle-tested [blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) in current usage, Ethereum is currently the most popular network for crypto tokens that don\u2019t have their own native blockchain. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Decentraland (MANA)?\n\nThe MANA token currently benefits from excellent [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) and can be purchased, traded or sold on around 100 different exchange platforms. As of January 2021, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) are among the most liquid exchanges for MANA tokens. A full list of available markets can be found in the \u201cMarkets\u201d section. \n\nMANA can currently be traded against [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), and Ethereum (ETH) \u2014 and can be purchased with a [range of fiat currencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/), including KRW and USD. \n", "dateAdded": "2017-09-17T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T08:41:29.000Z", "watchCount": "168012", "launchPrice": 0.025794, "tags":
