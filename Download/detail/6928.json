{"data": {"id": 6928, "name": "Bella Protocol", "symbol": "BEL", "slug": "bella-protocol", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Bella Protocol (BEL)?\n\nBella Protocol is a platform that provides a suite of DeFi products designed to make crypto banking simpler and more accessible. The protocol aims to create a better user experience by eliminating the high fee and slow transaction issues that can affect some [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platforms \u2014 while simultaneously improving the user experience through its simplified DeFi smart portal. \n\nBella's smart pool feature allows users to access the best yields available in the DeFi market, while benefiting from nearly zero [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) \u2014 since these are directly subsidized by the platform. \n\nThe project launched in September 2020 as the first project distributed via [Binance\u2019s](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) Launchpool platform, and has secured investments from several prominent firms, including Arrington XRP Capital and Ledger Capital. \n\nThe protocol was built by the ARPA team, a blockchain-based layer 2 solution for privacy-preserving computation. The BEL token is an essential component of the Bella Protocol ecosystem and serves as both a reward token that allows holders to participate in the governance of the platform.\n\nBEL can be used to farm fee rewards from the network, get exclusive discounts on Bella protocol products (such as its robo-advisor tool), and for earning staking rewards. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Bella Protocol?\n\nBella Protocol was co-founded by Felix Xu and Yemu Xu in 2020 and currently has its headquarters in Beijing, China. \n\nFelix Xu is the CEO of Bella and also the co-founder of ARPA, a privacy-preserving blockchain platform that incubated the Bella Protocol. Felix has several years of experience as a venture investor and analyst and is a veteran of the financial industry. Yemu, on the other hand, is a heavily experienced entrepreneur, with a history of analyst and consultant roles.\n\nThe rest of the Bella team overlaps with that of ARPA, which is composed of more than a dozen employees with a range of backgrounds in blockchain, finance, and product development. \n\n\n### What Makes Bella Protocol Unique?\n\nOne of Bella Protocol\u2019s main features is its simplified user experience and wide variety of products. \n\nThe platform consists of the following main products: the Bella Liquidity Mining platform, flexible savings, a one-click smart portal to deploy assets with zero gas fees on popular and profitable DeFi products, a lending platform, and the Robo-Advisor \u2014 which can be used to help with the investment selection process. \n\nDespite launching in September 2020, all of these products are already operational. \n\nThe platform is supported by BEL token holders, which are able to contribute to the governance of the platform by voting on potential upgrades, releases, and other parameters. It also serves as a reward for users that participate in staking \u2014 among other things. \n\nBella Protocol is a strategic move made by ARPA in order to extend its growing community into the DeFi sector through its familiar and simple to use mobile banking application. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nCheck out [Hard Protocol (HARD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hard-protocol/) \u2014 a similar DeFi protocol built on Kava.\n\nRead about [Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ocean-protocol/) \u2014 one of the most popular oracle networks for DeFi products.\n\nLearn how to use Uniswap with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap).\n\nFor the latest news, market updates, tricks, and tips, check out the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Bella Protocol (BEL) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nBella Protocol has a total supply of 100,000,000 BEL tokens and an initial circulating supply of 13,250,000 BEL.\n\nA large proportion of the initial supply was distributed via a Binance Launchpool, with 5% of the total supply allocated to participants. In addition, 6% of the total supply was sold in a private sale and 2% was sold through a public auction. \n\nThe private sale price was $0.75 per token and was conducted on August 18th, 2020 selling 6,000,000 BEL to raise $4.5 million. \n\nBeyond this, 18% of the total supply is reserved for the ecosystem, 4% for the reserve, 40% for user growth, 10% for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) rewards, and 15% for the team. Based on the expected rate of token releases, the BEL token should reach full dilution by ~2025. \n\nHow Is the Bella Protocol Secured?\n\nThe BEL token is an [ERC-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) that is secured by the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) network. This is secured by currently secured by an extensive mining network, which acts to ensure the network remains in [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) about which transactions are valid, and which are not. \n\nRight now, Ethereum uses the [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) consensus algorithm to maintain its integrity, but this will gradually be transitioned to [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POS) with the release of [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0). \n\nThe benefit of using a well-established [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) like Ethereum is that there are already more than 10,000 nodes in operation, helping to keep the network running smoothly. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Bella Protocol (BEL)?\n\nAs of December 2020, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) is by far the most liquid exchange for BEL. Beyond this, the token is available to trade at a variety of other exchange platforms, including MXC, Hotbit, and Binance Korea. The most popular trading pairs are BEL/USDT and BEL/BTC. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to purchase BEL or other cryptocurrencies with a credit or debit card, check out our [simple guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to get started.
