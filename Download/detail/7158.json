{"data": {"id": 7158, "name": "Burger Swap", "symbol": "BURGER", "slug": "burger-swap", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Burger Swap (BURGER)?\n\nLaunched in September 2020, Burger Swap is one of the first democratized, decentralized automated market makers ([AMMs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/bsc/)). It was built without the control of any centralized authorities through the use of smart contracts.\n\nBurger Swap is based on the DEMAX decentralized Binance platform; it enables a swapping mechanism with democratic procedures that allows the community to change system parameters through transparent voting.\n\nBURGER token staking allows any user to create proposals and influence the adjustment of transaction fees, block rewards and other system parameters of the Burger Swap exchange via voting.\n\nThe Burger Swap decentralized governance system was designed to prevent control by any centralized entity. Users are rewarded with BURGER tokens for creating liquidity, staking and voting within the governance system.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Burger Swap?\n\nBurger Swap is an implementation of ERC-2917 founded by Tony Carson and Drs. Mehmet Sabir and Suleyman Kardas. Its main aim is to improve on Uniswap through altering the incentive and governance models.\n\n\n#### What Makes Burger Swap Unique?\n\nAn automated market maker is a type of decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) that uses mathematical formulae and game theory to price assets. Burger Swap is a decentralized AMM on the BSC network.\n\nThe Burger Swap Bridge has the ability to swap coins from the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) network\u2019s [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard to the BSC\u2019s BEP-20 standard \u2014 and vice-versa \u2014 at low fees. It allows Ethereum users to seamlessly migrate to the BSC network and enjoy its low transaction fees and fast block times.\n\nBurger Swap was designed as a democratic and decentralized exchange with compulsory governance. BURGER token holders can vote to alter the exchange parameters such as trading fees, mining speed, staking rewards and others. \n\nAll tokens available on Burger Swap have a [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) and a BURGER trading pair. The BURGER pair is used to generate liquidity for the BURGER token and BNB is the native token of the BSC network. \n\nWhen a new project wants to get listed on Burger Swap, the exchange charges it with a listing fee and allows the community to approve or reject the listing via a vote. All of the listing fees are added to a pool and shared among BURGER holders that participate in voting at least once per week.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Essentia](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/essentia/).\n\nLearn more about [Gleec](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gleec/).\n\nLearn about peer-to-peer networks on [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-peer-to-peer-p2p).\n\nImprove your knowledge of cryptocurrencies with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Burger Swap (BURGER) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nBurger Swap (BURGER) has a circulating supply of 11,988,402 BURGER and a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BURGER as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Burger Swap Network Secured?\n\nBurger Swap employs a voting process to prevent the listing of suspicious token projects. It runs on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with fast block times and a focus on decentralization.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Burger Swap (BURGER)?\n\nBurger Swap (BURGER) can be traded on the
