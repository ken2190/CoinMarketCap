{"data": {"id": 8846, "name": "Fatfi Protocol", "symbol": "FAT", "slug": "fatfi-protocol", "category": "token", "description": "Fatfi is a decentralized open innovation platform that will foster a collaborative ecosystem, with the goal of dramatically accelerating the development and adoption of the world\u2019s most advanced technologies & strategies into the most attractive segment in DEFIverse: Liquidity Rewards\r\n\r\nOur protocol controls money supply similarly to how central banks of the world may guide the value of fiat money through monetary policy. \r\n\r\nBy controlling the quantity of money supply in an economy by buying or selling bonds, a target value can be achieved (In this case $1). \r\n\r\nThere are four tokens in the Fatfi protocol:\r\n\r\nFAT Token \u2014 Our Governance token\r\nFAC \u2014 Fatfi Cash: Our algorithmic stablecoin, designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism expands and contracts their supply, maintaining the price of $1.\r\nFAB \u2014 Fatfi Bonds tokens are designed to move in price and guide FAC to $1.\r\nFAS \u2014 Fatfi Shares. Fatfi Share token holders will be the backbone of the system, providing resources and guidance to the protocol.\r\n\r\nFatfi Products\r\n\r\n1. Fatfi Algorithm Stable Coin\r\nWhile several different designs of algorithm stablecoins have launched, we believe that the 3 tokens design is the best design out there. It\u2019s proven to be resilient while also having the widest distribution of users. Fatfi Cash is a Algorithm Stable Coin protocol, but in a better version having Governence Token \u2014 FAT. Of course, one of the natural questions that many may have is: \u201cWhy would someone want to participate in Fatfi, instead of others?\u201d.\r\nWith Others Algorithm Stablecoin, Users only earn the profit within the Expansion and Contraction of the protocol, which can easily come to a point that there is no more profit for users, because the main goal of a Stable Coin is stay Stable. Once the Protocol already come to that stage, without any further development of the project, the game is done.\r\nWith Fatfi, one can also participate in the Algorithm Stable Coin and earn rewards in the form of FAT tokens. However, unlike others, those FAT tokens will also entitle you to continue to earn a portion of the protocol\u2019s fee, accumulated in FAT, even if you decide to no longer participate in the Algorithm provision.\r\n\r\n2. Fatfi Defi Financial Services\r\nA bank with no Financial Services is a Money Game, is not a bank. The main logic behind Algorithm Stable Coin is the logic of the demand and supply, demonstrate how the governance bank manipulate the money supply. Our strategy is not trying to create, new financial products. With the development of DEFI, there is a lot of good DEFI financial products out there. We aim to create an Integration Application for Fatfi product into other financial service out there in DEFIverse.\r\n\r\n3. DAO\r\nFatfi will improve with several additions planned for implementation. New developments and respective budgets will be proposed via the Fatfi DAO. The community can decide on the development priority to fund and to be implemented in Fatfi. The DAO Reserve is planned to unlock by the 17th month.", "dateAdded": "2021-03-17T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:29:26.000Z", "watchCount": "436", "dateLaunched": "2021-03-14T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.01, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://fatfi.io"], "technical_doc": ["https://fatfi.gitbook.io/fatfi/"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x90e767a68a7d707b74d569c8e79f9bbb79b98a8b"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/fatfi"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/@fatfi"], "chat": ["https://t.me/fatfigroup"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/FatfiFinance"]}, "volume": 0.0, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "statistics": {"price": 0.00378962448665, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.05836936, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.37462312, "priceChangePercentage7d": 4.0154409, "priceChangePercentage30d": 7.14465172, "priceChangePercentage60d": -53.38122314, "priceChangePercentage90d": -76.66204912, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 454754.94, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 20.73, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 120000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 5591, "roi": -62.10375513, "low24h": 0.00370513, "high24h": 0.0038015, "low7d": 0.00360199, "high7d": 0.0038015, "low30d": 0.00337428, "high30d": 0.00395056, "low90d": 0.00301388, "high90d": 0.02016134, "low52w": 0.00301388, "high52w": 0.09200331, "lowAllTime": 0.00301388, "highAllTime": 0.09200331, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 25.74, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -95.88, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-22T14:01:07.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-03-17T14:52:06.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00370513, "highYesterday": 0.00380754, "openYesterday": 0.00375031, "closeYesterday": 0.00376742, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0.46, "volumeYesterday": 0, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x90e767a68a7d707b74d569c8e79f9bbb79b98a8b", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x90e767a68a7d707b74d569c8e79f9bbb79b98a8b", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.10734945164149, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.3258385, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.07822279}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.20228456848141, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.01863901, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.8715583}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04646938435769, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.59242332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.13094411}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34819853481682, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.69811924, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.29735003}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08917632064107, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.856402, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.12439624}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34449767575729, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.37764688, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.10600251}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.59340021063595, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.79388358, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.28813508}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12833740050694, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.57892734, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.12853881}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04992025559031, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.2087894, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.72992738}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:30:38.339Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
