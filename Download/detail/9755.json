{"data": {"id": 9755, "name": "Moma Protocol", "symbol": "MOMAT", "slug": "moma-protocol", "category": "token", "description": "Launched in December 2020, Moma Protocol is a proprietary solution to meet the growing demands for liquidity, scalability and speculation in DeFi lending markets.\r\n\r\nMoma Protocol uses a proprietary smart contract factory to produce, manage, accelerate and aggregate the lending markets, creating an ecosystem that can expand infinitely on lending liquidity and market diversity.\r\n\r\nFour key components of Moma Protcol are Factory, Launch Pool, Lending Pool and Aggregator. \r\n\r\nFactory is a smart contract factory that can produce and manage Launch Pool and Lending Pool. \r\n\r\nLaunch Pool is a customizable Pre-Lending Pool designed for community mining. Community tokens can be distributed for any projects through the Launch Pool. \r\n\r\nLending Pool is a customizable lending market pool with an over-collateralized loan structure. This pool can support lending and borrowing in any markets. \r\n\r\nLaunch Pool activates, accelerates and creates the lending scenario for Lending Pool. Lending Pool provides the interest-bearing scenario to generate revenue for Launch Pool. Both types of Pools provide use case scenarios for each other and creates a close-loop business cycle that generates infinite liquidity on the platform.\r\n\r\nAggregator is a calculator and analyzer based on Pool and market data. It helps users solve their personalized DeFi demands of lending, borrowing and community mining of crypto assets.\r\n\r\nTwo mechanisms of Price Feed are used: Committee Price Feed and Decentralized Price Feed.\r\n\r\nMoma Protocol creatively provided its own unique solution in risk management, including four core components: Crypto Asset Risk Rating Database, Whistleblower, Reserve Pool and Staking Management Pool.\r\n\r\nCrypto Asset Risk Rating Database acts as a risk prompt list for identifying any potential risks related to the crypto asset in the Lending Pool. Moma users can take into account the rating score of a particular crypto asset from the database when they are deciding their participation strategies. Whistleblower is the core mechanism of Moma's risk management framework. By staking Moma tokens, users can become Whistleblowers and submit risk warning information. Once the information is confirmed as valid, Whistleblower will receive incentives. Reserve Pool receives a portion of the interest revenue from Lending Pool and forms a fund pool. In situations where losses occur, the funds in the Reserve Pool will be mobilized for compensation. Staking Management Pool is a staking pool formed by Pool Builders when they are upgrading their pools by staking Moma tokens. If any management problems occur during the pool operation process and result in losses on the user side, Moma tokens in the Staking Management Pool will be mobilized to compensate the affected users.\r\n\r\nThe following are Moma's competitive advantages, as compared to Moma's competitors.\r\n \r\n1 Markets: Moma can support an unlimited number of assets, while other market players only support a limited number of assets.\r\n \r\n2 User-defined pools: Moma offers a customizable pool solution, while other market players do not.\r\n \r\n3 Application scenarios: Moma's use case scenarios are extended to Launch, Lending, and Aggregate, while other platforms' use case scenario limits to lending.\r\n \r\n4 Incentive tokens: Moma can support unlimited types of incentive tokens, not just its own platform tokens.\r\n \r\n5 Ecosystem: The Moma ecosystem caters for Pool Builders, Farmers, Lenders and Borrowers, while some major market players only serves Lenders and Borrowers.\r\n \r\n6 Risk management: Moma creates a multi-folded and sophisticated risk management framework, including: Token Risk Rating Database, Reserve Pool, Staking Management Pool, while other platforms mainly rely on a single token risk framework.\r\n \r\n7 Price feed: Moma has a strong Price Feed design that was designed to go decentralized in the long run, and completes price feeding through Comittee Price Feed, Whistleblower and Chainlink.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-12T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "icoStatus": "active_ico", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime":
