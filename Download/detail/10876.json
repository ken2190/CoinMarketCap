{"data": {"id": 10876, "name": "Mommy Doge Coin", "symbol": "MOMMYDOGE", "slug": "mommy-doge-coin", "category": "token", "description": "## What is Mommy Doge Coin (MommyDoge)?\r\nMommy Doge Coin is a meme token which forms the basis of the Mommy Doge non-fungible token (NFT) trading card game. The game is set in the Doge-meme universe, which has gained global attention and recognition for its cute appearance and desirability. The 1st edition of Mommy Doge NFTs are already listed on [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/MommyDogeCoin) and are being continuously expanded by digital artists emanating from the Mommy Doge community. Each Mommy Doge NFT trading card is a one-of-a-kind digital asset that cannot be duplicated and consequently holds value for collectors due to its desirability and rarity. The Mommy Doge Coin functions as future currency for these unique digital assets in an upcoming NFT marketplace for creators that is fully funded from trading fees and sales of the Mommy Doge token.\r\n\r\n## How many Mommy Doge Coins are in circulation?\r\nMommy Doge launched on July 3rd, 2021 with a total of 420,000,000,000,000,000 token. Shortly after contract creation, a 30% initial burn was performed to set the stage for the intended deflationary nature of the token. The BEP-20-based smart contract has a built-in transaction fee of 10% of the transfer value of which 50% are added to the liquidity pool and the other 50% are re-distributed among all holders according to the percentage of tokens owned. Since the burn wallet initially held 30%, the token is deflationary as with each transaction tokens are added to the burn wallet as well, meaning that over time less and less token will be in active circulation.\r\n\r\n## Who owns Mommy Doge Coin?\r\nMommy Doge was created by a divers team EU and US-based of crypto enthusiasts bringing together decades of industry experience in graphics design, web development, finance, contract design, programming, big data analytics, social media marketing, and community management. From the start, the goal was to develop this token as a community-driven project, which is why the ownership was renounced immediately after the token\u2019s release. Today, the token is solely owned by the holder community while the development team continues to work on the improvement of all token aspects from community expansion to NFT marketplace development. All these activities are community driven with frequent polls and AMAs during which every holder can bring forth questions, ideas, and suggestions for the further improvement of the token and its ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## How is the development of Mommy Doge financed? \r\nUpon creation, 10% of all tokens were deposited into a specialized wallet, of which 50% are allocated to marketing / development and 50% to charity projects. Both allocations are locked until the end of 2021 and vest in 50 steps from 0% to 100%, allowing restricted but successive access to the funds on an approximate frequency of two vesting events per week. The funds becoming available from the marketing / development allocation through this mechanism are dedicated to investments into activities that further the token\u2019s goals and popularity, in particular marketing expenses, listing fees, and NFT development. Because the token contract has a build-in redistribution of 50% of the transfer fees to all holders, the marketing / development allocations are also continuously gaining token from this mechanism.\r\n\r\n## What charity projects is Mommy Doge supporting? \r\nWhile being a fun meme token on the surface, Mommy Doge is on a serious mission to support and bring attention to women\u2019s rights and gender equality in general. This is not only reflected by a zero-tolerance policy towards discriminatory language in the social media channels that we control, but also through donations to tangible projects that bring our society closer to gender equality. The funding source for these activities is a dedicated allocation of Mommy Doge Coins that is locked from general access. The funds vest identical to the marketing / development allocation above.\r\n\r\n## Where can I buy Mommy Doge Coin (MommyDoge)?\r\nMommy Doge is available for trading on [PancakeSwap](
