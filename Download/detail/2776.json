The platform\u2019s creators claim that it is typically cheaper than traditional, mainstream booking platforms.\n\nTravala.com uses a native token, AVA, which powers the Customer Loyalty Program (Smart Program), Standard Booking Givebacks, Best Price Guarantee, Referral Program, Affiliate Program and more. \n\n\n### The Travala.com Team?\n\nTravala.com was founded by Steve Hipwell, Matt Luczynski and Juan Otero. They are a team with extensive experience in blockchain development, travel and fintech from some of the world\u2019s largest companies.\n\nCurrent CEO and co-founder Juan Otero brings a wealth of experience in some of the largest tech companies in the world including Oracle and Booking.com.\n\nCurrent COO and co-founder Steve Hipwell brings over 10 years\u2019 experience in the online travel booking industry.\n\nThe rest of the Travala.com team with over 60 team members hails from a wide range of disciplines and includes a combination of developers, engineers, designers, marketing experts and more.\n\n\n#### What Makes Travala Unique?\n\nThe main principle and goal of Travala.com is to make crypto payments a mainstream option in the travel industry. Travala.com also bills itself as a cheaper alternative to the traditional booking methods due to the fact that it has no hidden costs and has more transparent practices.\n\nAVA, the native token of Travala.com, powers an unrivalled loyalty program offering real-value tokenized rewards that can be saved or spent for travel of all types.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [1inch](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/1inch/).\n\nLearn about [UniLend](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/unilend/).\n\nLearn how to mine Bitcoin (BTC) on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin).\n\nLearn more about cryptocurrencies on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/).\n\n\n#### How Many Travala (AVA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nTravala.com (AVA) has a circulating supply of 49,872,252 tokens and a maximum supply of 61,112,681 AVA as of May 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Travala Network Secured?\n\nTravala is built on three layers that make its ecosystem possible, which are the Travala DApp, the Travala Protocol and the Travala Consensus. \n\nThe DApp layer functions as its user interface; its main goal is to allow the customers to browse offerings and book items according to their individual choice.\n\nThe protocol layer handles the economic engine of the platform and supports the implementation of the NEP-5 contract standard across the entirety of the layer. The protocol layer is also home to a host of smart contracts that govern the interactions between all stakeholders within the Travala ecosystem, including travelers and suppliers. The platform takes advantage of the Neo ([NEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/)) blockchain\u2019s smart contract functionality for the booking process itself. \n\nThe consensus layer handles the records on the Travala platform; this layer is completely built on the NEO blockchain and uses dBFT or delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol that uses some features of the delegated proof-of-stake consensus.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Travala (AVA)?\n\nIf you are interested in buying, selling, or trading Travala (AVA), you can do so on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*
