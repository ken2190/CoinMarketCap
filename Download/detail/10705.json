They allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto tokens, whose prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula. Liquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes, and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem.\r\n\r\nNow, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer (p2p) online service that allows direct cryptocurrency transactions between two interested parties. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are aimed at solving problems that are inherent in centralized exchanges. They create p2p markets directly on the blockchain, which allows traders to independently store and operating funds. Users of such exchanges can make transactions with cryptocurrency directly between each other \u2014 i.e., without third-party involvement.\r\n\r\nSo, what about CoinSwap Space? Founded on April 2021, CoinSwap Space is a decentralized exchange or DEX created for swapping BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. CoinSwap Space uses an automated market maker (AMM) model where users can trade against a liquidity pool. Those pools are filled with users\u2019 funds. They deposit them into the pool, receiving liquidity provider (or LP) tokens in exchange. Now, they can use those tokens to reclaim their share, plus a portion of the trading fees. \r\n\r\nCoinSwap Space\u2019s vision is to create a strong foundation for the community by giving them incentives in exchange for their support of the AMM model. Creating an advanced ecosystem for automated liquidity provisioned on the Binance Smart Chain.\r\n\r\nWho is our target? Our main target is consumers that are avoiding the high gas fees of Ethereum Blockchain. We are also aiming to become the best platform that you can use that operates in the AMM model of BSC.\r\n\r\nCoinSwap Space also allows users to farm additional tokens that are listed on the yield farming pool. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens, staking them in a process that rewards users with CSS tokens. Users can stake those CSS tokens to receive CSSl, which will have further functionality as a governance and utility token.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CoinSwap Space platform has the ability to launch new pools, as it is an automated market maker that utilizes smart routing that gives its clients the best swapping rate, slippage, and price impact available. \r\n\r\nThe liquidity provided to the swap comes from Liquidity Providers (\"LPs\") who stake their tokens in \"Pools\". In exchange for this, they get CS-LP (CoinSwap-LiquidityProvider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn CSS tokens in the \"farm.\"\r\n\r\nIf you need to know more about CoinSwap Space, more information is available at https://doc.coinswap.space/.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-29T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "307", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.25, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://coinswap.space", "https://app.coinswap.space"], "technical_doc": ["https://doc.coinswap.space/"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x3bc5798416c1122bcfd7cb0e055d50061f23850d"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/CoinSwap-Space"], "message_board": ["https://coinswap.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/CoinSwapSpace", "https://discord.com/invite/g9uW3zCgCp\r\nhttps://t.me/CSS_Announcments"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/CoinSwap_Space"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x3bc5798416c1122bcfd7cb0e055d50061f23850d", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x3bc5798416c1122bcfd7cb0e055d50061f23850d", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.99195551596571, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.37778497, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.76126544}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33076201801208, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.46531284, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.96789566}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04600186231469, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.14868791, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.17285939}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35225527622235, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.11423849, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.42822185}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08804213776288, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49769861, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.56837823}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3483481875156, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.45162233, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.05712907}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.82545567829481, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.69671449, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.87444725}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.1291243021993, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.62706083, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.22580141}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0504277483724, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.40139621, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.86305219}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:54:10.183Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "228", "credit_count": 0}}
