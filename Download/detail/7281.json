DApps within the Persistence ecosystem share a portion of their revenue/fee with XPRT stakers and validators\n3. Chain Governance: The XPRT token secures the network through staking, is used to pay for fees, and defines the weightage of vote for governance proposals to take critical decisions regarding the evolution of the Persistence chain\n\nPersistence operates at the confluence of DeFi, NFTs, and Proof-of-Stake and currently consists of 5 applications some of which are live and some will be going live in the year 2021 with many more applications in the pipeline\n1. Comdex: Comdex is an institutional user-facing application providing an end to end commodities trading solution such as trade discovery, trade settlement and trade financing\n2. pSTAKE: pSTAKE is a liquid staking application that allows stakers of prominent PoS networks to unlock liquidity of their staked assets and use these assets in DeFi while earning staking rewards\n3.

XPRT supply is capped to a maximum of 403,308,352 XPRT and will come into supply over the next 15 years. To bootstrap the ecosystem, XPRT stakers will receive approximately 35% staking rewards in the first two years (Inflation halves every 2 year).\n\n## Who are the founders?\nPersistence was established in Q2 2019 by Tushar Aggarwal (CEO) and Deepanshu Tripathi (CTO). \nPrior to founding Persistence, Tushar was the first employee at LuneX Ventures (crypto arm of a traditional Singapore VC- Golden Gate Ventures) and helped set up the fund which was the first regulated Crypto VC fund in Southeast Asia. Deepanshu was part of a three person team that created a unified payment acceptance platform which was whitelabeled to Reliance (investors include Facebook, etc) and eventually sold to an African fintech company for $9,000,000. \nPersistence is currently a 25 member team which includes developers from IIT-Bombay (the most premiere tech institute in India) and other top technology institutions
