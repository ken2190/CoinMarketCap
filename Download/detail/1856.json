{"data": {"id": 1856, "name": "district0x", "symbol": "DNT", "slug": "district0x", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is District0x (DNT)?\n\nBilled as a \"network of decentralized markets and communities,\" district0x is a platform that allows users to easily launch their own decentralized platforms which are governed by a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) structure. \n\nEach of these platforms is termed a \u201cdistrict\u201d and can be launched free of charge on the district0x. The ecosystem is powered by the custom d0xINFRA framework, which provides a set of basic [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and libraries users can use when building out their districts \u2014 enabling a wide array of potential use-cases. \n\nThe native token of the district0x ecosystem is DNT \u2014 an ERC-20 utility token that is mostly used for community governance. \n\nThe platform uses a combination of three main technologies: [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), Aragon and the InterPlanetary File Transfer Protocol (IPFS). \n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is used for hosting districts, whereas Aragon is used as the governance layer for the district0x network, allowing DNT stakers to benefit from governance rights and help shape the development and operation of their chosen districts. Lastly, IPFS is used for serving the district0x website source code and for user uploads within districts.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of District0x?\n\nDistrict0x was founded in February 2017 by Joe Urgo and Matus Lestan.\n\nJoe Urgo is a former professional poker player turned derivatives trader with an extensive history working as an advisor in the cryptocurrency space. He is also the founder and CEO of Sourcerers \u2014 a consulting firm specializing in tokenization and crowdsale services. \n\nMatus Lestan is a programmer and developer with close to a decade worth of experience working with web and mobile applications. He currently holds the position of lead developer at district0x. \n\nBesides the co-founders, much of the district0x team is not public facing. However, the district0x wages [transparency page](https://district0x.io/transparency/) indicates that there were at least five additional contractors working for the firm in early 2021.\n\n\n#### What Makes District0x Unique?\n\nDistrict0x is built to tackle some of the inefficiencies that come with creating and operating distributed community marketplaces. \n\nIt does this by providing a wide range of smart contracts and front-end libraries that developers can use to easily launch their own districts, while providing a simple platform for community governance. \n\nUnlike some other platforms which charge a fee for launching new applications, developers can create a district for free \u2014 though a refundable deposit will need to be paid to be added to the [District Registry](https://registry.district0x.io/). This easy access platform has already given rise to a range of successful districts, each of which have varying forms and functions. \n\nSome of the most popular districts include decentralized job market Ethlance, peer-to-peer ENS names marketplace Name Bazaar and Meme Factory \u2014 a district that provides a simple interface for the creation of rare digital assets.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Rarible (RAR)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rarible/) \u2014 a creator-centric [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) marketplace.\n\nCheck out [Aragon (ANT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aragon/) \u2014 a blockchain-based organization management solution.\n\n[Learn about Decentralized Exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex) with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.\n\nWant to stay on top of the market at a glance? Then follow the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog)!\n\n\n#### How Many district0x (DNT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of January 2021, at least 600 million DNT tokens were in circulation, representing 60% of the fixed maximum supply of 1 billion DNT.\n\nAll 600 million DNT were distributed to participants of the 2017 initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)), in which district0x raised a total of $9 million. Beyond this, 180 million DNT are held in reserve for possible future fundraisers, 22 million DNT are reserved for advisors and community rewards, and the remaining 198 million DNT is held by the district0x founders\u2014and subject to a two-year vesting schedule.\n\nOf this, the 180 million DNT reserved for fundraisers remains to be released. The district0x team have indicated this may be burned at a later date. An undisclosed sum of team and other reserved tokens may also be out of circulation. \n\n\n### How Is the district0x Network Secured?\n\nDNT is an ERC-20 token. As such, it is secured by the underlying [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). As of January 2021, this uses a proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) consensus mechanism to ensure the network is secured against attacks.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions to Ethereum 2.0, it will eventually be secured using a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) network instead \u2014 offering similar levels of protection against attacks at a lower energy cost. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy District0x (DNT)?\n\nThe DNT token currently benefits from excellent liquidity and is available to trade on several popular exchange platforms, including;\n\n\n\n*   [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   Bittrex\n*   [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) (DEX)\n\nThe most popular trading pairs for DNT include: DNT/USDC, DNT/USDT, DNT/BTC and DNT/ETH. As of January 2021, there are no direct fiat trading pairs for DNT. But you may be able to [buy Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) with fiat, and then exchange it for DNT. \n", "dateAdded": "2017-08-03T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active",
