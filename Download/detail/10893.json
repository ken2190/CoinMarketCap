The project has three interconnected parts that all serve a single purpose: to rapidly grow Brokoli\u2019s user base and offset DeFi\u2019s carbon footprint.\r\n\r\nBrokoli\u2019s core: Environmentally friendly gateway into the most popular DEXs and dApps.\r\n\r\nNFT rewards: Companies and individuals receive a green NFT based on the amount of trees they have funded the planting of. They share it on social media and spread the word about Brokoli.\r\n\r\nAPI: Any DeFi platform can implement our API to allow users to opt-in to a small climate fee that offsets their transaction\u2019s footprint.\r\n\r\nGoverning the protocol is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model that controls 100% of the climate offset funding, with the BRKL token at its core. This mechanism distributes the funds collected between Tree Planting, Renewable Energy and Electronic Waste Collection projects around the globe, with token holders having 100% control of the fund allocations. \r\n\r\nBrokoli solves DeFi\u2019s biggest issue by making climate action a part of every DeFi transaction, with $0 cost to the user. \r\n\r\n- Users of any DEX can still access the coins and liquidity of their DEX through Brokoli, but with even greater price discovery and with positive climate impact as part of every token swap\r\n\r\n- Users of any dApp get the same functionality and user experience without incurring additional costs but with contributing to climate positive action\r\n\r\n- Users see measurable impact on Brokoli\u2019s climate dashboard and get unique NFT rewards based on their impact", "dateAdded": "2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "4", "dateLaunched": "2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://brokoli.network"], "technical_doc": ["https://whitepaper.brokoli.network"], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://brokolinetwork.medium.com"], "chat": ["https://t.me/brokolinetwork"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/BrokoliNetwork"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.15277603529009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97491332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.15383074}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.34961053638639, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.48844037, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65699839}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04606059556592, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.60454635, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.52026324}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35073162374456, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.29500189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.00533147}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08805508567185, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49406181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.66853882}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33953608915345, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.35932698, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.52614735}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.81208358366918, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.33740637, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.63805644}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884983830176, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.8379087, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.06023177}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05089512649492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.3618099, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01964124}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:55:42.364Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
