Initial circulating supply allocation for Pancakeswap Liquidity is allotted with 150,000,000,000,000 tokens.\r\n\r\nThe SafeBank YES protocol works in the following ways: In each trade, the transaction is taxed with a fee of 10%, which is cut in half. While 5% of the fee is sent to the token burn address, the other 5% is then split in half again, with 50% sold by the contract into BNB, and the remaining 50% automatically paired with the aforementioned BNB and added to PancakeSwap as a liquidity pair.\r\n\r\n### Who are the founders of SafeBank YES?\r\n\r\nSafeBank YES is led by Xolane Ndhlovu (DafriGroup PLC Chairman) and Catherine Anajemba (Managing Director of DafriGroup PLC).\r\n\r\nXolane Ndhlovu is responsible for leading the Board and focusing it on strategic matters, overseeing the Group\u2019s business and setting high governance standards.
