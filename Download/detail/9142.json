{"data": {"id": 9142, "name": "Lemur Finance", "symbol": "LEM", "slug": "lemur-finance", "category": "token", "description": "Launched on 23/03/2021 on the Binance Smart Chain, LEM is a deflationary token with automatic, frictionless yield farming. A 5% tax is applied to every transaction: 3% is locked forever in LEM/BNB liquidity and is 2% distributed to holders proportionate to their holdings.\r\n\r\nFrictionless Yield Farming\r\nNo need to create liquidity and to provide your keys! LEM tokens remain in holder\u2019s wallets and they receive the 2% tax distribution without paying gas fees. This means no risk of impermanent loss when compared to traditional yield farming, and no risk of losing funds to malicious smart-contracts. This system rewards long term holders and penalizes speculators.\r\n\r\nHyper-Deflationary: An Ever-Rising Price Floor\r\n55% of the supply was sent to the BSC burn address at launch. Because this address also receives an allocation of the 2% tax mentioned above, the protocol effectively burns LEM tokens automatically, with an exponential increase over time. In addition the 3% liquidity tax is locked forever, essentially burning those tokens as well. These two features create hyper-deflationary pressures, resulting in an ever rising price floor for LEM.\r\n\r\nContract Ownership Burn -> 100% Community Controlled Project\r\n\r\nSimilar to Bitcoin, the dev is anonymous and gifted LEM to the community who is now fully in charge. The key differences are mentioned above, additionally all supply was minted at launch. No more interactions with the contract are possible - ownership was transferred to the burn address, thus eliminating any malicious manipulation through the LEM contract itself.\r\n\r\nUse-Cases & Future Developments:\r\nStarting as meme coin with a full story telling website, LEM plans to develop:\r\n- NFT Farming & Marketplace\r\n- Games\r\n- Mechanisms for $LEM to Support Real-World
