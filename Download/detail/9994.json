{"data": {"id": 9994, "name": "Fuck Musk", "symbol": "FUCKMUSK", "slug": "fuck-musk", "category": "token", "description": "Why Fuck Musk?\r\n\r\nFuck Musk is a unique memecoin looking to capitalize on recent trends and pop culture within the crypto space, while providing actual definitive usecases that coincide with a bearish outlook on financial markets. Specifically, it positions itself as a fork of the popular coin Safemoon, with variations to core features including Reflection, Automated Liquidity provision to pairs on decentralized exchanges, and Automated wallet provision for shorting stocks which include $TESLA.\r\n\r\nWhat unique features does Fuck Musk have?\r\n\r\nIn addition to its built-in tax per transaction that drives 3% to previous holders and 3% to its liquidity pair on decentralized exchanges, Fuck Musk also opens short positions via a 4% allocation per transaction. Numerous crypto exchanges have opened up trading pairs of tokenized stocks, with the TESLA/USD pair serving as one of the offerings on the FTX platform. Fuck Musk utilizes its pop culture positioning to offer crypto users the ability to enter short positions against the TESLA stock, while also operating as a Decentralized Finance (Defi) protocol.\r\n\r\nHow is Fuck Musk secured?\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 2021, after a successful launch of its token, the Fuck Musk protocol successfully executed its burn of a pre-planned supply of 400,000,000,000,000 FUCKMUSK tokens. After securing the protocol and overseeing the initial liquidity pair, the team consequently burned its Team tokens as well in order to perpetuate a 'fair launch', a common term in cryptocurrency referring to a crypto network that is distributed to its initial community in the spirit of equal footing and minimal first-mover advantage. The liquidity pair tokens provided were also locked via Team.Finance, and further liquidity is added through every transaction via its built-in transaction tax.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "206", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-19T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://fuckmusk.org"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x29c182e9d6bcda4f7331a903defa025e7b416964"], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://fuckmusk.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/fuck_musk"], "announcement": ["https://fuckmusk.medium.com/fuckmusk-fight-the-dicktator-fad4a8d3726a"], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/FuckMuskSocial"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x29c182e9d6bcda4f7331a903defa025e7b416964", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x29c182e9d6bcda4f7331a903defa025e7b416964", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.45150323169812, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.78238682, "priceChangePercentage7d": 54.81841345}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.11792015397708, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.07667436, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.5241191}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04627930324381, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.95586308, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.4414177}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.345099196673, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.24177142, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.51429989}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08806747212276, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.1332778, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.02404196}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3363672243517, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.21044411, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.38744057}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.6980542710299, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.329172, "priceChangePercentage7d": 16.45107756}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12784353668353, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.45273612, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.48580387}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04540853189561, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.17982405, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.60197009}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:38:49.921Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "13", "credit_count": 0}}
