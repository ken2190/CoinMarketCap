While other similar projects attempt to outperform the banking system, Pundi X looks to simplify transforming retail businesses to make this happen.\n\nPundi X has created a blockchain payment ecosystem with the XPOS, XPASS and the virtual XWallet.

Users can use the XWallet to easily manage their digital assets, make transfers, check balances, and top-up the supported cryptos in the XWallet. The virtual XPASS card is issued to every registered XWallet user.\n\nIn June 2019, Pundi X launched the Open Platform to support more blockchains. Since then, DeFi developers and projects have registered and uploaded their ERC20 tokens to the Pundi X ecosystem, increasing its use.\n\n\n#### Related pages:\n\nFind out about [BitPay (BAY)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitbay/)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Learn how to keep your [cryptocurrency safe](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-keep-your-crypto-safe).</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Learn about cryptocurrency with [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/9-things-to-know-before-investing-in-cryptocurrency).</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Read the latest posts on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).</span>\n\n\n\n## How Many Pundi X (NPXS) Tokens Are There in Circulation?\n\nLike the native tokens of other payment-centered crypto platforms, the great majority of the Pundi X (NPXS) tokens have been issued.
