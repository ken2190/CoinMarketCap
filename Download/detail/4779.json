{"data": {"id": 4779, "name": "HUSD", "symbol": "HUSD", "slug": "husd", "category": "token", "description": "What Is HUSD (HUSD)?\n\nHUSD is a secure, reliable, and fiat-collateralized[ stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin). It combines the stability of the US dollar and the efficiency of blockchain technology. Additionally, it provides holders with a tool to reduce volatility when trading in the cryptocurrency market. When designing the project, the development team focused on security, liquidity and convenience. HUSD was created to provide price stability to attract a serious crypto trading audience and simplify interactions with global markets. \n\nDevelopers announced the HUSD project in 2019. Later, Stable Universal released HUSD in compliance with all required US legal requirements. This organization attracts skilled developers to ensure they provide the safest and most reliable services to end-users. HUSD is issued as an[ ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on the Ethereum blockchain and is backed at a 1:1 ratio by US dollars held in US bank accounts. The HUSD token is held in reserve by the Paxos Trust Company. This measure is essential to provide oversight and support from the regulatory authorities. Every month, a leading US auditing firm conducts tests to ensure that USD reserves are matched against HUSD supplies.\n\nThe HUSD token (the name a combination of Huobi and USD) is listed on the[ Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) exchange platform and can be converted to any of these four stablecoins:[ PAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/paxos-standard/),[ TUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/),[ GUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gemini-dollar/), and[ USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/). Investors can also deposit and withdraw stablecoins using the all-in-one stablecoin solution.\n\nWho Are the Founders of HUSD?\n\nFrank Zhang is the honorable founder and CEO of Stable Universal. The company is headquartered in Central District, Hong Kong, and Stable Universal operates in the Financial Services sector. Prior to that, Zhang worked at the Bank of China (New York) as BSA Officer, AVP.\n\nClaude Gu is another HUSD team member. His role at Stable Universal is Senior Overseas Operations Manager. Gu studied digital and graphic communication at Hong Kong Baptist University, and holds an MA in new media from the same university. In 2016, he was Senior Digital Account Executive at SAME SAME but different (Paris). In 2018, he focused on Corporate Social Media Operations at Lenovo (Beijing), and in 2020 he joined Stable Universal.\n\nShi Deng is the final founder of HUSD. He is the designated BSA Officer and Compliance Director at Stable Universal. Deng was educated at Fudan University (Bachelor of Laws) and at Fordham University (Master of Laws). He became a part of Stable Universal in 2019.\n\nWhat Makes HUSD (HUSD) Unique?\n\nThe HUSD team is committed to providing a secure and interoperable product in the form of a dollar-pegged stablecoin. The developers understand stablecoins are a rapidly developing segment that could be the missing puzzle piece to mass crypto adoption.\n\nHUSD was first launched in 2018 and was listed on the Huobi Global exchange. The main idea of the stablecoin was to combine four others \u2014 Paxos Standard (PAX), True USD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC), and Gemini Dollars (GUSD) \u2014 into one HUSD token. However, users didn\u2019t want to trade using HUSD, as the token pricing seemed opaque to them. Huobi then decided that the stablecoin should not depend on the exchange. In 2019, Stable Universal and Paxos stepped in to secure the ERC-20 HUSD stablecoin. Since then, Huobi has transferred the previous stablecoin to a new and universal one.\n\nThe HUSD cryptocurrency is a token based on the[ Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. HUSD exists as an ERC-20 token, allowing it to be integrated with Ethereum-based applications. When a user needs to redeem HUSD, they send tokens to the address for which Stable Universal is responsible. There (via Paxos), tokens are transferred into fiat currency to the user's bank account. This allows traders and exchanges to use HUSD as an alternative to fiat currencies.\n\nFeatures that make HUSD stand out:\n\n\n\n*   Every dollar supporting the HUSD token is held in reserve by Paxos Trust Company. This means that the HUSD token fulfills the industry's established requirements for stablecoins.\n*   It is completely integrated with Huobi Global, one of the most well-known liquid exchanges in the cryptocurrency world.\n*   The platform has a quick, straightforward login (and logout) through a service launched by Stable Universal. With its help, you can easily purchase and redeem HUSD tokens.\n\nRelated Pages:\n\nRead about[ Paxos Standard (PAX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/paxos-standard/),[ USD Coin (USDC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) and[ Binance USD (BUSD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/).\n\nWhat is a stablecoin?

As of June 2021, 555,449,408 tokens were issued, the same amount in circulation. The total supply of HUSD is backed by fiat currency, which is held in the Paxos reserve. If there is a request for the purchase (or redemption) of HUSD tokens, then cash is transferred to the reserve and back.\n\nThe only party that can affect the turnover of HUSD tokens is Stable Universal. The organization issues tokens when users' fiat currency is deposited into a Paxos account. And when tokens are redeemed for fiat deposits in Paxos bank accounts, Stable Universal destroys the tokens.\n\nTo demonstrate the system's solvency, HUSD resorts to a reserve confirmation system to provide full collateral. Moreover, Stable Universal publishes reports that prove the existence of the dollar reserves, which keep the tokens in circulation. The HUSD token can also be used to pay for a variety of goods and services.\n\nHow Is the HUSD Network Secured?\n\nHUSD is a highly decentralized and secure token that was built on top of the Ethereum network.\n\nHUSD transactions follow instructions laid out by ERC-20[ smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). This aspect eliminates the need to use third parties by relying on the secure and tested blockchain network. Furthermore, you shouldn\u2019t have any problems with trading tokens, because all movements are supported by a considerable number of exchanges and wallet applications that Ethereum supports.\n\nHUSD is audited and secured by SlowMist, and the platform complies with Know Your Customer ([KYC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc)) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.\n\nWhere Can You Buy HUSD (HUSD)?\n\nHere are the steps to purchase HUSD: \n\n\n\n*   [Log in](https://www.stcoins.com/) to your HUSD account (or sign up); \n*   Verify your identity; \n*   Make a dollar deposit; \n*   Place an order to buy HUSD tokens.\n\nThe main crypto exchange platforms where you can trade HUSD tokens include:[ Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/),[ Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/),[ MDEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mdex/),[ Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/),[ Pionex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pionex/),[ Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/),[ 0x Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/0x-protocol/),[ Tokenlon](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/tokenlon/https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/tokenlon/),[ NUT MONEY](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/nut-money/), and[ BHEX (BlueHelix Exchange)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bhex-bluehelix/).\n\nNew to crypto?
