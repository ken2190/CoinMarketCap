This tax is used as follows: 2% is instantly and gaslessly distributed to the holders of SAFEMARS. There is no need to farm or claim, holders will simply see more SAFEMARS tokens in their wallet. 2% is paired with BNB and automatically added to liquidity, thereby constantly increasing the price floor of SAFEMARS.\n\nSAFEMARS notes that for each transaction, the SAFEMARS protocol will automatically distribute the rewards to holders, as well as auto-locking the liquidity forever.\n\n\n### What Is Yield Farming?\n\nWhat is yield farming in cryptocurrency and decentralized applications?
