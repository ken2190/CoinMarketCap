Our team at FLURRY believes that investment opportunities should NOT be reserved only for tech-savvy crypto enthusiasts but for everyone.\n\nFlurry provides a cross-chain token (rhoToken), comprising stablecoin advantages along with continuous yield farming. The protocol automates the tedious task of locking/unlocking and switching in and out of DeFi products on different chains for generating yield. Most importantly, rhoToken is pegged 1:1 to the backing stablecoin and thus can act as a medium of exchange. In other words, no more lock-up!\n\n**Other advantages of using Flurry includes:**\n\n\u2022 Lower Gas Costs per User\n\n\u2022 Risk Diversification\n\n\u2022 Nice User Interface\n\nSimply put, FLURRY aims to improve the usability of DeFi products and make the process as convenient as possible so everyone can participate.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Flurry?\n\n\nFlurry was co-founded by Mike Ting and Lawrence Wong.
