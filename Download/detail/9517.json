It will help empower traders by making it easier for them to invest with less money in the real estate and stock market with anonymous dividend and yield payments.\n\nCustomers can earn interest by holding SWIN Token on the Binance Smart Chain.\nStaking SWIN Token works via the RFI mechanism where there is no need to freeze tokens or store them in any special wallets. This not only generates passive income, but also keeps some tokens out of circulation and encourages holding and not selling.\n\nThe smart contract adds 8% fee to each transaction. Out of this, 3% fee will be distributed amongst holders, thus a strong holder will receive a valuable reward. Remaining 5% will be added to the liquidity pool by smart contracts that are locked. This adds to the trading experience and makes it deflationary. The token will be a bridge to the stock market. There can be automated transfers of dividends directly from and to bank accounts. In the real estate field, ownership of each property is distributed across Swinate holders. Based on specific token share, owners will have the ability to collect revenue from rent, and vote on property decisions. After creating the token with solid token economics, the passive income community token with a rising price floor will be evolved into a utility token.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "599", "tags": [{"slug": "real-estate", "name": "Real Estate", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "staking", "name": "Staking", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "binance-smart-chain", "name": "Binance Smart Chain", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.swinate.io/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x8592fb0e6724a90ce45f05f31b85bddd45931560"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/swinate"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/SWINATEIO"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x8592fb0e6724a90ce45f05f31b85bddd45931560", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x8592fb0e6724a90ce45f05f31b85bddd45931560", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.51961028446848, "priceChangePercentage24h": 40.05897643, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.08756307}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.09993818062774, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.86982167, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.75462837}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04639215361782, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13811962, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76587648}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34600204194768, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.31417693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.96994307}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08817176397124, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.22152403, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.30137851}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33359854728193, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.66084021, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.4943706}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.62329345078651, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.8204927, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.27014225}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12773403744909, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.63156837, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.11450108}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04584695150434, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.05885686, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.84051332}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:35:25.936Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "133", "credit_count": 0}}
