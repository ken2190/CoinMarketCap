{"data": {"id": 77, "name": "Diamond", "symbol": "DMD", "slug": "diamond", "category": "coin", "description": "### What Is DMD Diamond?\n\nDMD Diamond is one of the oldest projects on the cryptocurrency market and the first blockchain to implement a cooperative consensus with a delegated PoS-powered validator election.\n\nFounded in 2013, DMD Diamond is constantly evolving and upgrading to new market conditions. \n\nIts 2021 upgrade \u2014 DMD v4 \u2014 features true decentralization, on-chain governance, fast transaction times, low fees, low carbon footprint, security, interoperability, and smart contracts deployment. DMD v4 utilizes the world\u2019s first blockchain with a cooperative HBBFT consensus supplemented by a dPOS-based validator election. On top of that, DMD v4 is the first blockchain to implement a sustainable and endless reward mechanic with a low max finite supply of just 4.38 million coins.\n\n### How Many DMD Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nDMD Diamond has a maximum supply of 4.38 million coins, over 81% of them are already in circulation and the rest is slowly powering node rewards for the upcoming decades.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of the project?\n\nDMD Diamond is one of the few blockchain projects governed by the community only. The original creator of DMD disappeared a few months after its launch in 2013. Since then a small team of developers and enthusiasts maintain and evolve the code and adjust the vision for the coin.\n\nFor now, the most active members in the DMD Diamond community are Aleksander Mesor, Helmut Siedl. Technical knowledge and code improvements and development of v4 is handled by Thomas Haller, Dr. David Forstenlechner, and Dietmar Hofer.\n\n### Where Can I Buy DMD Diamond?\u2028\nDMD Diamond is available on exmarkets.com, crex24.com and soon will be available on coinmargin.com. DMD Diamond was traded on Bittrex for years and we are looking for it to be readded to the platform after the v4 release.\n\n### What Makes your project Unique?\n\nDMDv4 is the first cooperative consensus blockchain with a delegated PoS-powered validator election which allows for high speed and performance, absolute censorship resistance and fork resistance, instant finality of transactions, and other advantages that cannot be delivered by a competitive consensus. Additionally, it is a unique industry-first mechanism that reinserts abandoned and unclaimed coins into circulation. \n\n### Related Pages:\n\nWebsite: [https://bit.diamonds/](https://bit.diamonds/)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/dmdcoin](https://github.com/dmdcoin)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/dmdcoin](https://www.facebook.com/dmdcoin)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/dmdcoin](https://twitter.com/dmdcoin)\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dmd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dmd/)\n\nChat: [https://dmdcoin.slack.com/](https://dmdcoin.slack.com/)\n\n### How Is your project Network Secured?\n\nDMDv4 is secured with HBBFT Honeybadger cooperative consensus and a dPOS like a node election protocol based on POSDAO (similar dPOS system to that, which was used by xDAI blockchain). This combined is a true decentral solution that follows the ideals of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n", "dateAdded": "2013-12-19T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T08:28:04.000Z", "watchCount": "2354", "launchPrice": 0.573386, "tags": [{"slug": "masternodes", "name": "Masternodes", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "staking", "name": "Staking", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["http://bit.diamonds"], "technical_doc": ["https://bit.diamonds/DMD_WP.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dmd/", "https://masternodes.online/currencies/DMD/", "https://dmd.tokenview.com/en"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/DMDcoin/Diamond"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["http://dmdcoin.slack.com/"], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=580725.0"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/dmd"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/dmdcoin"]}, "volume": 20545.64015493, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 20.1857, "statistics": {"price": 2.38713896017419, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.28118035, "priceChangePercentage24h": 3.65110528, "priceChangePercentage7d": 16.42335571, "priceChangePercentage30d": 15.44081808, "priceChangePercentage60d": -5.55453667, "priceChangePercentage90d": -10.25782178, "marketCap": 8634753.61, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 3.6584, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 10455668.65, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": -5.85, "circulatingSupply": 3617197.72137702, "totalSupply": 3617197.72137702, "maxSupply": 4380000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0005, "rank": 904, "roi": 316.3232029, "low24h": 2.21251744, "high24h": 2.41005656, "low7d": 2.03655996, "high7d": 2.39944051, "low30d": 1.71185434, "high30d": 2.41005656, "low90d": 1.71185434, "high90d": 3.44587673, "low52w": 0.37412242, "high52w": 7.83482835, "lowAllTime": 0.05550552, "highAllTime": 42.3992157, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 4200.72, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -94.37, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2014-08-29T08:44:04.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2018-01-02T11:54:05.000Z", "lowYesterday": 2.21251744, "highYesterday": 2.39944051, "openYesterday": 2.30256054, "closeYesterday": 2.39376567, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 3.96, "volumeYesterday": 23029.2, "turnover": 0.00237941, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 40.1266}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1, "name": "Bitcoin", "slug": "bitcoin", "price": 41637.68042999702, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.87094862, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.41883178}, {"id": 3884, "name": "Function X", "slug": "function-x", "price": 0.29580882183114, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.08525949, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.10384767}, {"id": 3156, "name": "Airbloc", "slug": "airbloc", "price": 0.01841346360655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.55107379, "priceChangePercentage7d": 7.22475224}, {"id": 2212, "name": "Quantstamp", "slug": "quantstamp", "price": 0.03353342956803, "priceChangePercentage24h": 3.65862694, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.15488434}, {"id": 2469, "name": "Zilliqa", "slug": "zilliqa", "price": 0.07922510811759, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.53111773, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.18912472}, {"id": 4134, "name": "Akropolis", "slug": "akropolis", "price": 0.02132507890512, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.06272733, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.86070218}, {"id": 74, "name": "Dogecoin", "slug": "dogecoin", "price": 0.20734671071508, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.90947155, "priceChangePercentage7d": 7.34603384}, {"id": 8104, "name": "1inch", "slug": "1inch", "price": 2.32376544839465, "priceChangePercentage24h": 3.37568569, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.57441206}, {"id": 7737, "name": "API3", "slug": "api3", "price": 4.21044905811479, "priceChangePercentage24h": 14.69075019, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.53022545}, {"id": 2586, "name": "Synthetix", "slug": "synthetix-network-token", "price": 9.68238678642902, "priceChangePercentage24h": 0.61725189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.55605357}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 215, "name": "P2PB2B", "slug": "p2pb2b"}, {"id": 535, "name": "ExMarkets", "slug": "exmarkets"}, {"id": 382, "name": "Crex24", "slug": "crex24"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T08:29:14.503Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
