{"data": {"id": 9301, "name": "Unique Fans", "symbol": "FANS", "slug": "unique-fans", "category": "token", "description": "When the volunteer founding team built the Unique.One Art Marketplace on Ethereum in 2020, it had a primary objective \u2014 create an open decentralised community-run platform for all artists to be able to mint their art as NFTs. \r\n\r\nThe team was aware of the level of censorship by corporate-backed platforms that were barring artists from entering a flourishing \u201cart-tech renaissance\u201d during a difficult economic time. \r\n\r\nThe Unique.One team listens to the Unique.One community for direction. In response to high Eth gas prices, it built an additional marketplace on xDai. In response to the particular needs of photographers, it created Unique.Photo. The struggles of erotic artists have not gone unnoticed. \r\n\r\nAfter one of our community members was interviewed by Motherboard, we realised the need for a platform exclusively for NSFW NFT creators.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as what is considered 'art' is infinitely debated and in the eyes of the beholder, what is considered inappropriate varies greatly amongst individuals,\" our community member said. \r\n\r\nMotherboard also pointed out that with NSFW NFTs, the beholder seems to have become the platforms themselves. This got our attention.\r\n\r\nUnique Fans Responds to the Needs of Erotic Artists:\r\nErotic artists are continually dogged by barriers to monetising their art. Beyond the obvious struggle of social media and platform restrictions, payment processors cancel accounts, and middlemen take a fair chunk of their earnings. \r\n\r\nWhile the NFT space offers solutions for many of these issues, ongoing censorship on major NFT platforms, even those with dedicated NSFW categories, have become a source of frustration.\r\n\r\nAll of it calls into question who is to decide what constitutes art? Or, as Motherboard put it, who is the beholder? \r\n\r\nUnique holds the position that the community itself is the beholder and decides what art is, not the platform. Diverse community groups organically grow around different genres of art to naturally support their artists and create networks \u2014 if given the opportunity without the interference of centralised censoring authorities. \r\n\r\nThe Vision for Unique Fans:\r\nUnique Fans is a space where creators can develop a more intimate relationship with fans who have the freedom to support the artists they care about by becoming investors in the art they appreciate. \r\n\r\nNetworks and followings can be built in peace without the fear of a centralised authority imposing subjective judgments on what is or what is not art. \r\n\r\nThe blockchain also provides innovative ways for NSFW artists to protect against theft of their art, which is a huge problem in the erotic art space, where stolen pornographic content is disseminated by illicit aggregators. \r\n\r\nNFT artists who mint their works on-chain before any other online exposure have the opportunity to create an archive of provenance. They can also elect to protect their work from copyright infringement on-platform with watermarks, only releasing the original image upon purchase.\r\n\r\nUnique Fans will be a 100% community-governed, decentralised dedicated NSFW NFT Arts Marketplace and insists on remaining an open platform. The Fans Community Terms and Guidelines are meant for the protection of artists, the community, and the innocent to keep the platform legal and accessible \u2014 not to be used to selectively silence the voices of creativity in the Adult Art Genre.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-19T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "50", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-06T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://unique.fans"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33d0eb1c0c0295c3a2409a9101dd511823bf217"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/Unique-Fans-Official"], "message_board": ["https://uniquefans.medium.com/"], "chat": [], "announcement": ["https://t.me/UniqueFansCommunity"], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/UniqueFan01"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0xd33d0eb1c0c0295c3a2409a9101dd511823bf217", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33d0eb1c0c0295c3a2409a9101dd511823bf217", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.39573307597338, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.99695168, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.65196276}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.13951826462414, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.41720606, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.23403521}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04642130446666, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47479612, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76378252}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34543127132665, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.10634214, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.07975349}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08809375205785, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47012283, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.20479819}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3365804189963, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.72571723, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.81210172}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.61551425760311, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.84200543, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.02118715}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12756201108951, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.48873139, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44700682}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04698230570444, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32158169, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.92562492}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:33:53.208Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
