{"data": {"id": 3964, "name": "Reserve Rights", "symbol": "RSR", "slug": "reserve-rights", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Reserve Rights (RSR)?\n\nReserve Rights is a dual-token stablecoin platform that was launched in May 2019 following a successful initial exchange offering ([IEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering)) on the Huobi Prime platform. \n\nReserve Rights\u2019 dual token setup includes a stablecoin known as the Reserve [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) (RSV) \u2014 which is backed by a basket of assets managed by smart contracts. The second token is the Reserve Rights token (RSR), which is used to keep the RSV stable at its $1.00 price target through a system of arbitrage opportunities.\n\nUnlike RSV, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token is volatile, and its main purpose is to help maintain the stability of RSV. It can also be used to vote on governance proposals \u2014 helping holders shape the future of the Reserve Rights ecosystem. \n\nIn the later stages of the project, Reserve Rights plans to back the Reserve stablecoin by an increasingly diverse basket of assets, and eventually move it away from the U.S. dollar peg \u2014 instead creating an alternative reserve asset where RSV tokens instead represent fractional ownership of the collateral pool. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Reserve Rights?\n\nReserve Rights was co-founded by Nevin Freeman and Matt Elder. Freeman is Reserve's CEO and a seasoned entrepreneur. He describes his life goal as \"solving the coordination problems that are stopping humanity from achieving its potential.\" \n\nMatt Elder, on the other hand, is an experienced engineer who previously worked for Google and Quixey, and now works to oversee the architecture of the Reserve protocol implementation as the project\u2019s CTO.\n\nSince its launch in 2019, the Reserve team has grown considerably, and now includes more than two dozen individuals, which includes engineers, developers, and legal and compliance staff \u2014 all unified under the shared ambition to position Reserve as an open, massively scalable stablecoin that promotes economic prosperity.\n\n\n#### What Makes Reserve Rights Unique?\n\nUnlike other stablecoins that are typically backed by U.S. dollars (USD) held in reserve in a bank account controlled by the stablecoin issuer or a trusted custodian, Reserve stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies managed by smart contracts. \n\nThis basket initially consists of Ethereum stablecoin assets, including USD Coin ([USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/)), True USD ([TUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/)) and Paxos ([PAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/paxos-standard/)), but there are plans to later transition to a more diverse basket, which might eventually include fiat currencies, securities, commodities and complex asset types, like synthetics and derivatives.\n\nArguably Reserve's major defining feature is its Reserve Rights token, which is minted and sold when the RSV stablecoin loses its peg with the U.S. dollar. The funds generated by selling RSR tokens are used to replenish the RSV collateral pool, whereas when RSV is valued at above $1, the additional collateral will be used to purchase and burn RSR from the secondary market, driving down the supply. \n\nArbitrageurs can benefit from this mechanism when RSV is valued at above $1.00, by buying RSV at $1.00 from the Reserve smart contract using RSR, and then selling it at the current market price to net the difference as profit. This option is only available to RSR holders, and is currently one of the main drivers for holding RSR tokens. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead about [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) \u2014 a similar stablecoin backed by a basket of assets.\n\nRead about [Libra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/facebook-libra/) \u2014 an upcoming basket-backed stablecoin from Facebook.\n\nStuck on an unfamiliar term? Find out its meaning on the [CoinMarketCap Glossary.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary)\n\nCheck out the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) to discover the latest insights and tools to help you stay on top of the market. \n\n\n#### How Many Reserve Rights (RSR) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nReserve Rights has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens. Out of this, less than 10% are currently in circulation as of October 2020. \n\nThe maximum token supply has already been pre-mined, but a large proportion is locked for various reasons, including 55.75% of the supply locked in a smart contract known as the \"slow wallet.\u201d Funds from this wallet are released following a one-month delay with a public on-chain message from the Reserve team explaining the purpose of the withdrawal. \n\nAlthough RSR has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens while on Ethereum, the Reserve team has [stated](https://reserve.org/blog/reserve-faq) that this maximum supply might change once Reserve moves to its mainnet \u2014 an event currently slated to occur in 2020.  \n\nThe Reserve Rights token initially launched with a circulating supply of 6.85 billion tokens, of which 3% were distributed to Huobi Prime IEO participants, 2.85% released as project tokens and 1% to private investors. All team, advisor, partner, and seed investor tokens will remain locked until after the mainnet is launched.\n\n\n### How Is the Reserve Rights Network Secured?\n\nReserve Rights is currently an ERC-20 token based on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. As a result, it is secured against [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) by a robust [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) consensus mechanism backed by a network of thousands of Ethereum miners. \n\nReserve Rights is scheduled to migrate to its mainnet in 2020. As of October 2020, Reserve has not yet announced which [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) mechanism the new [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) will use to secure the network. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Reserve Rights (RSR)?\n\nReserve Rights (RSR) is a popular token that currently maintains excellent liquidity. \n\nIt is available to purchase and trade on several of the most well-established cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Binance, [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), and can be traded against various popular cryptocurrencies, including [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as the U.S. dollar (USD) on multiple platforms. \n\nTo get started, consider [buying Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) with your credit or debit card. You can then exchange this for Reserve Rights tokens on various exchanges.", "dateAdded": "2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T08:54:39.000Z",
