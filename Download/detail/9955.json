This will enable investors to see if a token has a high chance of being a scam by just glancing at the Ragnarok Interface. This interface will be composed of information provided in a clean and easy to read way thanks to our design team.\nAutomatic Audits\nMachine learning will be implemented to the Ragnarok Interface to provide the user with a confidence score for a particular token.\nOur community has shown it\u2019s talents once more and has given us 3 Machine Learning experts that will be building an AI which will allocate a confidence score of 0\u2013100% to a project based on how safe it is. By making our interface automated, we can offer this service for every single token in BSC, similar to PooCoin Charts. You\u2019ll just have to \u2018paste\u2019 a Contract Address and our algorithms will do the magic.\nOptional Audits and KYC\nWe will also offer Optional Audits and KYCs to project owners so they can prove to their community the legitimacy of their project. Once a project is Audited, KYCed or both, it will show up in the Ragnarok Interface as a stamp or certificate to let users know that the project has completed the optional tasks. This gives users additional security when investing in a token.\nThe Ragnarok (ROK) token\nIn order to give more value to the token and fund this project, the ROK token will be used in two ways.\nFirstly, audits will need to be paid in the form of liquidity. This means that if a project owner wants to have our audited stamp in their token, they will need to provide liquidity to the ROK liquidity pool. These tokens will then be required to be sent to a development wallet where they will be accumulated to enable CEX listings in the future.\nSecondly, only holders of the ROK token will be allowed to use the platform. This means that our community will keep growing and our token will become even more valuable. The specific requirements are still to be decided but it won\u2019t be expensive and will be calculated at the current dollar price. This means that we will not be excluding people with lower funds.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-14T17:23:11.000Z", "watchCount": "4289", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-10T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://ragnaroktoken.com/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x1717Cc260bACB7841B37Fed8d06846101b31e5C8"], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://ragnarok-token.medium.com/ragnarok-token-day-2-and-3-summary-deep-dive-into-our-use-case-af248f1d151d"], "chat": ["https://t.me/ragnaroktoken"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/RagnarokToken"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/Ragnarok_Token"]}, "volume": 0.0, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x1717Cc260bACB7841B37Fed8d06846101b31e5C8", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x1717Cc260bACB7841B37Fed8d06846101b31e5C8", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.45150323169812, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.78238682, "priceChangePercentage7d": 54.81841345}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.11792015397708, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.07667436, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.5241191}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04627930324381, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.95586308, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.4414177}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.345099196673, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.24177142, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.51429989}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08806747212276, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.1332778, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.02404196}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3363672243517, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.21044411, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.38744057}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.6980542710299, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.329172, "priceChangePercentage7d": 16.45107756}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12784353668353, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.45273612, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.48580387}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04540853189561, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.17982405, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.60197009}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:38:32.546Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
