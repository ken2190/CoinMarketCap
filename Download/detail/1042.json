{"data": {"id": 1042, "name": "Siacoin", "symbol": "SC", "slug": "siacoin", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Siacoin (SC)?\n\nSiacoin (SC) is the native utility token of Sia, a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based distributed, decentralized cloud [storage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/storage-decentralized) platform. Sia acts as a secure, trustless marketplace for cloud storage in which users can lease access to their unused storage space. Agreements and transactions are enforced with [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), and Siacoin is the medium of exchange for paying for storage on the network. The main [goal](https://sia.tech/about) of the project is to become the \"backbone storage layer of the internet.\"\n\nSia was originally [announced](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=591283.0) in May 2014 before being revised and [re-announced](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1060294.0) a year later in May 2015. It officially [launched](https://twitter.com/NebulousLabs/status/607639984489811969) in June 2015.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Siacoin?\n\nSia was first [conceived](https://siawiki.tech/about/history_of_sia) in mid-2013 by David Vorick while studying computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He discussed the idea over email with Luke Champine, a college friend, who joined the project's development shortly after Vorick presented the concept at a HackMIT hackathon in September 2013. The project was officially named Sia in early 2014, a reference to the Egyptian god of perception.\n\nVorick and Champine were introduced through their college's entrepreneurial center to Jim Pallotta, a billionaire investor and founder of Raptor Group, who invested in the project. Shortly before graduating from college, the two [incorporated](https://www.abra.com/blog/money-3-0-david-vorick-from-sia-talks-about-decentralized-digital-ownership/) the company Nebulous Inc. \u2014 which has since been [rebranded](https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-the-future-of-nebulous-c9922eb53456) to Skynet \u2014 to formally handle the development of Sia.\n\n\n#### What Makes Siacoin Unique?\n\nAccording to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), the long-term [goal](https://sia.tech/sia.pdf) of Sia is to compete with existing storage solutions. It [sees](https://blog.sia.tech/meet-sia-the-most-viable-non-financial-application-of-blockchain-technology-afe6e7412a25) itself as being in direct competition with major cloud storage providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Because of its decentralized nature, Sia is able to [offer](https://blog.sia.tech/cloud-storage-for-2-tb-mo-8a34043e93bb) competitive storage rates.\n\nFiles [stored](https://sia.tech/technology) on the Sia network are divided into 30 encrypted segments, with each segment uploaded to a unique host for redundancy. The agreements between uploaders and hosts are recorded on Sia's blockchain and enforced using smart contracts. Siacoin acts as the method of payment on the network, with renters paying hosts using SC, and hosts locking SC in smart contracts as collateral.\n\nSkynet, the company behind Sia and Siacoin, has announced several products built on top of the Sia network, including [SiaStream](https://blog.sia.tech/siastream-is-the-new-home-for-all-your-media-dd51ac7b06ec) \u2014 a cloud-based media streaming application \u2014 and the [Skynet](https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-bdf0209d6d34) network \u2014 its flagship content delivery and file sharing network.\n\nThe company has received several rounds of funding and grants, including from [Bain Capital Ventures](https://sia.tech/funding2019), [Paradigm](https://sia.tech/funding2020) and [INBlockchain](https://sia.tech/2017grant). In addition, each storage-related transaction on the Sia network is subject to a 3.9% fee, which is [distributed](https://blog.sia.tech/sc-and-sf-the-economics-that-power-the-sia-network-f0b8d1899348) to holders of the company's second [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), Siafund \u2014 with Skynet holding approximately 85% of all Siafund.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn about [Filecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/), a decentralized storage system that seeks to store \"humanity\u2019s most important information.\"\n\nLearn about [MaidSafeCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maidsafecoin/), the currency of the SAFE decentralized data network.\n\nWant to know more about the Skynet network? [Read a deep dive](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-skynet) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on the latest innovations in blockchain and decentralized storage with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Siacoin (SC) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nSiacoin has no maximum supply. Because it is a utility token designed to be used to power transactions via smart contracts, the project has [stated](https://support.sia.tech/article/TziYOGhl38-siacoins-total-supply) that there must be a limitless supply in order to match the effectively limitless amount of data that can be created and stored.\n\nNew Siacoin is introduced as mining rewards through the Sia blockchain's [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) mining algorithm. The mining reward started at 300,000 SC and decreased at a rate of 1 SC with each block mined until it [reached](https://siastats.info/block_reward) 30,000 SC in July 2020. The block reward will now forever remain 30,000 SC. Siacoin is removed from the ecosystem when hosts lose tokens or their collateral is left unrefunded due to bad actions. In the future, the development team [intends](https://trello.com/c/xynwRelr/56-add-proof-of-burn-mechanic-to-hosts) to introduce a proof-of-burn mechanism by which hosts will be required to burn a small percentage of their revenue to prove that they are real and have good intentions.\n\nThe Sia development team [mined](https://siawiki.tech/wallet/siacoin) approximately 100 blocks (around 30 million SC) before publicly releasing the mining algorithm. The platform's team and investors reportedly hold less than 0.1% of the total Siacoin supply.\n\n\n### How Is the Siacoin Network Secured?\n\nThe Sia blockchain is secured using a proof-of-work [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm, meaning that miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority must confirm a record for it to be posted. Sia co-founder Vorick [argued](https://blog.sia.tech/choosing-asics-for-sia-b318505b5b51) in June 2017 that proof-of-work is the best way to secure the network because it tethers a malicious actor's ability to attack the network to massive energy requirements and hardware expenses.\n\nAccording to Sia's development team, the fact that hosts have to put up collateral in order to participate in the network's operations [decreases](https://blog.sia.tech/addressing-thoughtful-concerns-about-sias-security-viability-103ccfff5e92) any incentive for bad actors. In addition, it has [pointed to](https://twitter.com/SiaTechHQ/status/1169240559111888897) the fact that it splits uploaded data into 30 segments, which are then distributed across the globe, as reassurance that its network cannot be taken down except in the event of a massive natural disaster or geopolitical event. And as long as 10 out of 30 hosts survive an attack on its network, files can still be retrieved.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Siacoin (SC)?\n\nSiacoin can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) and [Upbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upbit/), among others. It can be traded on spot markets against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the South Korean won, cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), and the [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT).\n\nAre you interested in buying Siacoin or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin)?
