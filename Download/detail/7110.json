{"data": {"id": 7110, "name": "New BitShares", "symbol": "NBS", "slug": "new-bitshares", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is NBS?\n\n\nNBS is an OSS (open source) solution for DeFi (decentralized finance) business and DEX (decentralized exchange) based on DPOS consensus and implemented with DAO's organizational management structure. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm developed to secure a blockchain by ensuring representation of transactions within it. DPoS is designed as an implementation of technology-based democracy, using voting and election process to protect blockchain from centralization and malicious usage. The graphene technology used by NBS is one of the most advanced blockchain technologies on the market.\n\n\nNBS is the native utility token that is used for:\n\n\n* Fees for processing transactions and storing data.\n* Used for governance votes to determine how network resources are allocated.\n* Offers the capability to loan your NBS holdings with customizable reserve levels \n* Rewards for NBS system Contributors includes witness and workers.\n\n\nNBS tools include: \n\n\n* NBS SDKs which includes standard data structures and testing tools . \n* NNS Wallet that lets application developers create streamlined user experiences. \n* NBS Explorer to aid with both debugging of contracts and the understanding of network performance. \n* NBS Command Line Tools to allow developers to deploy applications from local environments.\n\n\n\n\n## How Many NBS Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\n\nNBS Protocol launched its mainnet on Sept. 11, 2020 with fixed 3.6 billion NBS tokens created at genesis (No additional issuance in its lifetime). Circulating Supply were 3095718947 as dated March 3rd.2021. 500 million NBS is reserved in the fund pool for witnesses, system development and NBS network architecture maintenance costs..\n\n\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of NBS?\n\n\nNBS technology was created in July 2014 and is the first brainchild of  Steem  and  EOS  cofounder and CTO Dan Larimer, along with Ethereum and Cardano cofounder Charles Hoskinson.\n\n\nNBS is an OSS (open source) solution for DeFi (decentralized finance) business and DEX (decentralized exchange) based on DPOS consensus and implemented with DAO's organizational management structure. The graphene technology used by NBS is one of the most advanced blockchain technologies on the market and was developed by Dan Larimer.\n\n\nSince launched on September 10, 2020, NBS has been adhering to the concept of \u201cusing DeFi to achieve a win-win situation, reconstructing the economic ecology of the public chain, and using free sharing to achieve DeFi inclusive applications\u201d, and has revolutionized the application of smartcoins by introducing the currency-based and coin-based liquidity mining as well as the perpetual margin contract market on the NBS DEX. Cross-chain (NBS-Connect), oracle machine (NBS-Forcast), virtual machine EVM and NFT are added to the original graphene structure. Reconstructing the economic model of the public chain through DeFi allows the NBS ecosystem to form a true closed loop. At the same time, as an efficient blockchain DEX infrastructure, NBS greatly reduces the capital threshold and cost of trading. The NFT function can be applied to fields such as digital collectibles, game projects, digital goods, event tickets, real estate, ID cards, certificates, etc.\n\n\n\n\n### Where Can I Buy NBS?\n\n\nNBS is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges, with cryptocurrency and [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) pairs currently available.\n\n\n[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) offers the largest number of pairs as of Sept. 2020, while [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) also offers [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC),  and [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) options.\n\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?
