{"data": {"id": 9812, "name": "Gorilla Diamond", "symbol": "GDT", "slug": "gorilla-diamond", "category": "token", "description": "Gorilla Diamond Inc. is a Canadian Crypto corporation based out of Ottawa, Ontario, which launched the\r\nGorilla Diamond Token (GDT) \u2013 a Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) token \u2013 on April 10, 2021. Despite the\r\ncompany\u2019s youth, the veteran leadership at the top level is evident. Gorilla Diamond Inc. is fully licensed\r\nto operate under the provincial and federal scope in Canada - it abides by all the provincial and federal\r\nlegislation and regulations that exist. Accordingly, the company is extremely transparent in all of its\r\nactivities; from posting a copy of their Article of Incorporation and official GOV. Certificate on their\r\nwebsite, to posting all of the transactions that go through their wallets, to providing its shareholders\r\nwith insight into their future plans and the opportunity to contribute. They will soon begin the process\r\nof registering with FINTRAC. Gorilla Diamond token has recently been listed by Coin Gecko and can be found\r\nat this link: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gorilla-diamond\r\n\r\nSo what makes $GDT one of a kind in the crypto world? Well, apart from the fact that their BNB presale\r\nsold out in less than 10 minutes, with a growing popularity; they plan on creating and implementing a\r\ncontinuous profit-sharing model. Their profit-sharing model will be implemented throughout the life-\r\ntime of the company with various projects that they plan to launch. Profit sharing is only for investors who hold\r\n$GDT tokens. In efforts to launch this project, Gorilla Diamond Inc. is creating a platform called the Diamond\r\nService Market (DSM), which will revolutionize the peer-to-peer service exchange category.\r\n\r\nGorilla Diamond Inc. will disrupt the business model of crypto Corporations by leading the way with\r\nprofit-sharing to all their token holders - from company developments to various initiatives within\r\ndivisions of the corporation. Gorilla Diamond\u2019s CEO, Ahmad Hassan, believes in bridging the gap\r\nbetween dividend-making stocks in the outside world and profit-sharing token models in the crypto\r\nworld \u2013 to bring them to one reality.\r\n\r\nGorilla Diamond Inc. launched their deflationary token with a reflection rate of 6%, which means $GDT\r\ntoken holders receive a 6% reflection from each transaction processed on the blockchain. This can\r\namount to massive gains for investors who hold their $GDT tokens for longer periods of time. The\r\ncompany\u2019s plans to utilize a profit-sharing system on their platforms is in addition to the already existing\r\n6% reflection rate distributed to $GDT holders. Gorilla Diamond Inc. will begin development of the DSM\r\nproject during Q3 of 2021, with plans to launch the platform to the public by Q4 of 2021.\r\n\r\nAs Gorilla Diamond Inc. continues to expand, they have secured deals with additional exchanges, which\r\nrank in the Top 25 worldwide. The company will be collaborating with some very large names in Canada\r\nvery soon and will be releasing these announcements on their website. $GDT is expected to grow, with\r\nincreasing transactions by the hour. With the development of the DSM, and the implementation of a\r\nprofit-sharing model, the company expects exponential growth in the upcoming months. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is still time for investors to purchase their $GDT and watch their money grow.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-14T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime":
