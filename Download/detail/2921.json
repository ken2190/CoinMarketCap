{"data": {"id": 2921, "name": "OneLedger", "symbol": "OLT", "slug": "oneledger", "category": "token", "description": "### What Is OneLedger (OLT)?\n\nLaunched in 2017, the shortcut for blockchain development to speed up blockchain adoption OneLedger is a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) solutions company that uses its own blockchain technology to support its customer's business need.\n\nOneLedger's mission is to simplify businesses' adoption of blockchain technology and its integration into their specific business applications and products. The company focuses on blockchain technology in the Healthcare, Asset Management, and Supply Chain sector partnered with Google Cloud and IBM.\n\n#What is the OneLedger protocol?\n\nOneLedger is a unique engine, not an adjunct of an existing platform.  Unlike other blockchain projects, we built it from the ground up. Our mainnet blockchain uses an enhanced consensus DPoS on Tendermint, which consistently replicating an application on many machines so OneLedger can combine different consensus in the same chain.\n\nOneLedger has built Mainnet - Kratos and Testnet - Chronos with an open, modular architecture, using plug-and-play components. It delivers robust interoperability characteristics unique in the market.  \n\n#On Oneledger protocol, you can :\n\n- Deploy customizable private/public sidechains that will communicate with each other interoperable with the main chain.\n- Compatible with ETH but with ultrafast transaction speed(1,000 x faster than ETH)with low transaction costs(1,000,000 x cheaper than ETH)\n- Interoperability protocol with Ethereum and BTC, soon any chain (BSC, POLKA, MATIC, etc.)\n- Can build public or private chain, side chain or off-chain and on-chain on either centralized or decentralized platform.\n- Use SDK or virtual machine to help developers to learn blockchain quickly.\n- OneWallet is available on Google Chrome Web Store, and you can soft stake to get rewards from 15% APY.\n\nThus, OneLedger provides customized blockchain solutions for business needs by building customizations on top of their proprietary blockchain software with integrations into third-party software systems and tools.\n\n##Who Are the Founders of OneLedger?\n\nGeorge Connolly is the founder and CEO of OneLedger and a Forbes top 100 executive member and specializes in Systems Integration. George has worked as Private sector System Integration Technology Leader 15+yrs, PwC Technology Leader; Commonwealth Business Council - Government National Strategic Plan Consultant, Global ECM/Digital Transformation Leader.\n\nGeorge has established deep relationships with decision-makers across the Caribbean, and Central America can thrive in closing business and creating opportunities throughout the value chain. \n\nHe is known for innovative solution sales, marketing, advertising, and promotional strategies that focus on a point and deliver the desired results.\n\n##What Makes OneLedger Unique?\n\nCurrently, most of the blockchains exist as isolated networks introducing two significant restrictions, among others: No practical way to transfer value directly between different blockchains and the Inability of businesses and individuals to quickly deploy distributed applications (Dapps) across multiple blockchain platforms. \n\nBut OneLedger interoperable feature supports cross-chain transactions and has business modules that can drive sophisticated processing like atomic swaps between other chains. Regardless of their chains, all can communicate with each other chains or cross communicate with the enterprise\u2019s existing data or flatforms.\n\nThis makes it an ideal foundation for developing enterprise-grade applications and industry solutions across a broad array of use cases. It acts as a gateway between enterprise systems and other public/private or on/off chains. \n\nBecause of this interoperability, OneLedger has attracted the bit partners like IBM and Google Cloud and talks with Canadian and Caribbean governments.\n\n##How Is the OneLedger Network Secured?\n\nIn Feb 2020, Hacken performed a blockchain security review of the OneLedger protocol, analyzed blockchain implementation, tested the potential attacker endpoints, reviewed the architecture, made a smart-contract audit, and confirmed that the original code of OneLedger was noted to be of outstanding quality. \n\n##How Many OneLedger (OLT) tokens Are There in Circulation?\nOLT has a maximum and a total supply of 1,000,000,000 OLT tokens. The current circulating supply is 45% 454,443,187.71 OLT.\n4.4% of the token allocated to the team, 5% for the Company reserve, Community Reserve of 30% is distributed as 5% for Bounty programs and 25% for block rewards; in-depth OneLedger Tokenomics is here.\n$OLT is primarily a utility token and is used to interact with the platform in various ways: Interoperability, Staking, Delegation, Governance, DApps, Creation of Custom Tokens, and a Domain Naming Service.\n\nOne of the main areas of focus for OneLedger is interoperability. OLT is used as fees for all the interoperable operations across chains. OneLedger\u2019s expertise is connecting businesses to blockchains, keeping their centralized data consistent with the transfer of assets on the blockchain. \n\nOLT is also utilized for any transaction a private business blockchain makes on the public network. Considering the volume of transactions for businesses, this will be a significant boost to the utility of OLT.\n\nA future capability of OneLedger is the ability to create Custom Tokens, similar to Erc-20 for Ethereum. Providing this service for businesses is critical when considering digitizing assets or making a credit system for loyalty programs.\n\n\n##Where Can You Buy OneLedger(OLT)?\n\nThe OneLedger platform attracts enterprise investors\u2019 attention as OnePass(International Health Passport) is launched and gaining attention from enterprises and governments, and more use cases are onboards.\nIf you want to purchase OLT tokens, your best option is Gate.io, which has the largest trading volume.\n\nOther good options if you are looking to purchase OLT include:\n\n-[Kucoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/)\n-[AscendEX (Bitmax)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ascendex/)\n-[CoinEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinex/)\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?
