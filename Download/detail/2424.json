{"data": {"id": 2424, "name": "SingularityNET", "symbol": "AGIX", "slug": "singularitynet", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is SingularityNET (AGI)?\n\nSingularityNET is a [blockchain-powered](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform that allows anybody to easily \"create, share, and monetize\" AI services, thanks to its globally-accessible AI marketplace.\n\nThrough the SingularityNET marketplace, users can browse, test and purchase a huge variety of AI services using the platform\u2019s native utility token \u2014 AGI. Moreover, the marketplace represents an outlet AI developers can use to publish and sell their AI tools, and easily track their performance. \n\nThe team behind SingularityNET pioneered the development of an AI known as Sophia, which is described as the \"world's most expressive robot\". SingularityNET\u2019s goal is to enable Sophia to be able to fully understand human language, and continue developing \u201cOpenCog\u201d \u2014 an AI framework that is hoped to eventually achieve a state known as \u201cadvanced general intelligence,\u201d i.e. human-level artificial intelligence (or beyond). \n\nThe platform was first announced in 2017 and completed an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) in December the same year, raising $36 million in just one minute. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of SingularityNET?\n\nSingularityNET has an extensive team largely of AI scientists, developers, researchers and engineers. \n\nIt was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel (SingularityNET's CEO and chief scientist) in addition to Simone Giacomelli and Dr. David Hanson.\n\nDr. Ben Goertzel is an established figure in the AI and robotics industry and has a long distinguished track record of working with advanced technology companies \u2014 including Hanson Robotics and the OpenCog Foundation. He also works as Mozi Health's chief scientist and vice chairman for Humanity+.\n\nSimone Giacomelli is an entrepreneur and investor that previously worked for crypto consultancy Cryptodex. He left the SingularityNET project in March 2019 and is now focused on the technology R&D lab Vulpem, which he founded in 2015.\n\nDr. David Hanson is SingularityNET's third co-founder. He has a long and varied history in the robotics industry, working with Disney between 1998 and 2001 before founding several robotics startups \u2014 including Human Emulation Robotics, Initiative for Awakening Machines and Hanson Robotics over the last two decades.\n\n\n#### What Makes SingularityNET Unique?\n\nSingularityNET is the first platform that makes it easy for developers to sell their AI tools and libraries and enables buyers to test any AI service provided on the marketplace to see if it meets their needs before making payment. \n\nOn top of this, those in need of specific AI services can also tap SingularityNET\u2019s extensive community of AI specialists through the Request for AI portal (RFAI) \u2014 which allows customers to easily commission a new AI tool, while developers can earn AGI tokens by filling these requests. \n\nThe utility of the AGI token has evolved with the development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. In October 2020, SingularityNET launched its SingularityNET Enhancement Proposal (SNEP) feature, enabling AGI holders to vote on changes to the network\u2019s operations. Whereas in March 2020, a staking feature was added, enabling users to stake their tokens \n\nIn a collaboration with Hanson Robotics, SingularityNET recently released a joint venture known as Awakening Health, which develops products that leverage AI for healthcare purposes. Its first product is Grace, a humanoid assistant for the healthcare industry.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck our [Rarible (RARI) ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rarible/)\u2014 a decentralized marketplace for non-fungible tokens.\n\nCheck out [Uniswap (UNI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/) \u2014 the governance token for the Uniswap decentralized exchange.\n\nLearn about [decentralized exchange (DEXs)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex) with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.\n\nMeet the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog) \u2014 your source for crypto insights, updates, and announcements.\n\n\n#### How Many SingularityNET (AGI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of February 2021, a total of 861.5 million AGI tokens representing 86% of the total supply were in circulation. As such, AGI can be considered largely diluted.\n\nHalf (50%) of the total AGI supply was sold during SingularityNET's 2017 ICO. Beyond this 20% was reserved for early developer and partner incentives, 18% for the core team members (now fully vested), 8% for the SingularityNET foundation for the long-term development of the platform, whereas the last 4% was reserved for security bounties.\n\nSince the total supply is fixed at 1 billion tokens, AGI does not have any inflation. \n\n\n### How Is SingularityNET Network Secured?\n\nAGI is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token. \n\nThis means it\u2019s backed by the Ethereum [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm and battle-tested network of tens of thousands of nodes and miners. To date, the Ethereum network has never been successfully [attacked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) and is considered one of the most secure networks currently operating. \n\nThe team behind SingularityNET has hinted that SingularityNET may move to another blockchain in the future, and recently [announced](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-collaborates-with-iohk-to-explore-cardano-agi-synergies-8bd1570ffab2) it was exploring the possibility of launching on the delegated proof-of-stake ([dPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) [Cardano](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/) blockchain. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy SingularityNET (AGI)?\n\nThe AGI token is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), KuCoin, and HitBTC. It's also available on two of the most popular [DEXs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) \u2014 [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and Balancer. Currently, the only available trading pairs for AGI are AGI/BTC, AGI/ETH, and AGI/WETH. \n\nIt is not currently possible to purchase AGI directly with your credit or debit card from any of these exchange platforms, but you may be able to buy [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) first, and then exchange this for AGI.
