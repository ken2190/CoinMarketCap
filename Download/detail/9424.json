{"data": {"id": 9424, "name": "Gaugecash", "symbol": "GAUF", "slug": "gaugecash", "category": "token", "description": "# What Is The Gaugecash protocol (GAUGECASH)\r\n\r\nThe Gaugecash protocol is a decentralized electronic money system that consists of 2 tokens: \r\nGaugecash(GAU): a stable crypto currency that represents an index of weighted averages from 35 global fiat currencies.  \r\nGaugefield(GAUF): the protocol\u2019s stability token that backs up each minted GAU. Each minted GAU is backed by decentralized cryptoassets. Users can stake GAUF using $LINK & $ETH.\r\n\r\nThe Gaugecash protocol aims to empower users to make stable payments on-chain or store value while hedging against the volatility risks of any single fiat currency. The protocol\u2019s backup(decentralized digital assets) and price Index(i.e not being 1:1 pegged to a fiat currency) mitigates CEFI risks and was designed for users looking for alternatives to current prominent fiat pegged stable crypto currencies.\r\n\r\n## How Many GAUGECASH (GAU) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of the Gaugecash Protocol?\r\n\r\nGaugecash was founded in 2019 by Manuel Blanco Appleby(Founder) and Federico Charles(Co-Founder). Manuel is a Physicist and serial entrepreneur, he has a 20 year career background in the Over the Counter Finance Industry, as a professional trader for ACM Markets now Swissquote bank Manuel was distinguished as one of their top money managers. In 2009 the start-up he co-founded, Clasemovil(company sold in 2011 to McGraw Hill Education) was featured in TechCrunch 50 as the best innovative education company. \r\nIn 2016 Manuel \u0301s Consulting Firm, Dados a tu Favor SA de CV, won a 300K USD R&D government grant by Conacyt (Mexican council for Science and Technology) to develop mathematical models to unveil behavioral patterns of the most traded Asset in the World, EUR/USD. After this project in 2018 he realized that most fiat pegged stable cryptocurrencies were not up to the standard of innovation that developments like Bitcoin and Ethereum had set in previous years. In 2018 with his research he began the theoretical basis of a global stable crypto currency based on an index of world fiat currencies that reflected the monetary policy of the globe backed by decentralized crypto assets. In 2019 he founded Gaugecash, a crypto asset backed stable crypto currency based on an index of 35 fiat currencies.\r\nFederico has more than 20 years of experience in the financial industry, with expertise in fintech, startups, payments, supply chain finance, and blockchain technology.\r\nHe has been passionate about financial inclusion from the beginning of his career, having founded the first non-bank financial institution in Mexico issuing a credit card for the underbanked segment of the population, called Nemesis, a payday loan app linked to a payments card.\r\n\r\nAfter selling his company in 2017 he was Country Manager for Payfare Inc., a Toronto based company developing payment solutions for the gig economy. In 2019 he got involved with blockchain technology and started doing business development as VP for LATAM Growth @ Virtublock-Zoompass ( OTCQB: ZPAS) a Canadian crypto-asset exchange and asset tokenization company. Having co-founded Gaugecash with Manuel in 2019, in January 2020 Federico became Gaugecash's CFO managing all finance and business strategies for the team.\r\n\r\n#### What Makes Gaugecash Unique?\r\n\r\nGAUGECASH protocol uses various APIs from international financial institutions to calculate the basket\u2019s weighted average index price. This weighted index represents a broad range of fiat currencies, resulting in a stable basket resistant to regional monetary policy movements. It also retains stability beyond prominent single-fiat pegs such as USD-based stablecoins. GAUGECASH uses this stable index as a benchmark currency to power it\u2019s peer-to-peer DeFi monetary system.\r\n\r\nGAUGECASH integrates into it\u2019s protocol market-leading oracle network Chainlink to access a GAU/USD decentralized price feed. The Chainlink-powered GAU/USD Price Feed ensures that the Gauge Index is priced against USD at fair market value and without possible tampering.\r\n\r\nThe GaugeIndex\u2019s mathematical formulation brings to the end user 2 exciting innovations:\r\nIf any major fiat collapses in the future(hyperinflation, massive devaluations) the index converges to a stable value. \r\nTesting the behaviour of the index we can demonstrate that it outperforms any other fiat currency in the world, delivering the best available purchasing power at any given time.\r\nBeing backed by decentralized digital assets users can opt out of traditional CEFI monetary systems.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-22T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "125", "dateLaunched": "2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.08, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.gaugecash.com"], "technical_doc": ["https://drive.google.com/file/d/192AGCZTuID3pjZQQAy9kh9oUHyHMDLS-/view"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/gaugecash"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/gaugecash"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/GAUGECASH"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0x8ce7386fe7688417885adebcbfc01a5445226b2c", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0x8ce7386fe7688417885adebcbfc01a5445226b2c", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.51961028446848, "priceChangePercentage24h": 40.05897643, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.08756307}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.09993818062774, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.86982167, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.75462837}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04639215361782, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13811962, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76587648}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34600204194768, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.31417693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.96994307}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08817176397124, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.22152403, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.30137851}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33359854728193, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.66084021, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.4943706}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.62329345078651, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.8204927, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.27014225}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12773403744909, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.63156837, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.11450108}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04584695150434, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.05885686, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.84051332}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:34:46.028Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
