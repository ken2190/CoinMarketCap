Altura is a smart contract platform that allows game developers to mint,\r\ndistribute and transact Smart NFTs representing in-game items. Smart NFTs are NFTs\r\nwith dynamic properties that can change based on certain conditions. Smart NFTs are\r\nthe next step to making decentralized in-game items mainstream and offer a massive\r\nrange of potential opportunities that are not possible with traditional NFTs. We want to\r\ncreate an easy-to-use interface and API for creating Smart NFTs, an open marketplace\r\nfor transacting NFTs using the Altura token, and we want to introduce truly random\r\nsmart loot boxes to the blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAltura is creating: \r\n\r\n* A marketplace for buying, selling and sending NFTs\r\n* A user interface for creating smart NFTs\r\n* Loot boxes that drop NFTs and a way to create loot boxes\r\n* APIs and SDKs for video game integration\r\n\r\n\r\nALU is the native utility token that is used for:\r\n\r\n* Transactions on the Altura NFT marketplace\r\n* Governance and determining the direction of the platform\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of Altura?\r\n\r\nFounder and Lead Developer\r\nMajd, an ambitious young entrepreneur, is the developer of Portfolio View and the host of the Eager Money YouTube channel with 15,000 subscribers.

She has over four years of administrative business experience and has been investing in cryptocurrency for over two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Many ALU Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThere is a maximum supply of 1 billion ALU. However, only 220 million ALU are in circulation at the time of writing. 450 million ALU are locked in vesting contracts that are dedicated to marketing, supply for potential DEX and CEX listings, operation and development, reserve and advisory, and team allocation. Additionally, 330 million are locked in another vesting contract, which are to be released to private investors and IDO investors over a period of time. \r\n\r\n## Where Can I Buy ALU?\r\n\r\nALU is currently only available in Pancake Swap where it can be purchase using BNB!
