{"data": {"id": 5488, "name": "JUST", "symbol": "JST", "slug": "just", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is JUST (JST)?\n\nJUST is a popular new decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) ecosystem built for the [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). It is an entire suite of products that are mostly centered around a decentralized stablecoin lending platform known as JustStable. \n\nThe platform launched in August 2020 following an initial exchange offering (IEO) on the Poloniex LaunchBase platform earlier that same year, but the native governance token of the platform (JST) has been circulating since May 2020. \n\nIt is a two-token ecosystem built around the USDJ and JUST (JST) tokens. [USDJ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdj/) is a multi-collateral [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) that has its value pegged to the value of the US dollar (USD), whereas JST has a variety of functions on the platform \u2014 paying interest, helping maintain the platform and participating in its governance, helping to set parameters like interest rates (stability fees) and the minimum collateralization ratio. \n\nTo obtain USDJ on JUST, traders need to deposit collateral in the form of supported collateral tokens \u2014 including TRON (TRX), which are exchanged to PTRX tokens and locked as collateral forming a collateralized debt position (CDP). Depending on the amount of collateral deposited, users can then mint and withdraw USDJ, which must later be repaid to retrieve the initial collateral. \n\nThe platform is designed to provide a fair and borderless hub of [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) products, that any TRON user can access. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of JUST?\n\nThe JUST ecosystem is managed by the JUST Foundation, which includes individuals from Alibaba, Tencent, IBM and \"other world-class internet companies,\" while JUST's financial analysis team hails from \"several global investment banks\" according to the project website.\n\nSome of the most prominent individuals include Terance F (a blockchain expert and ex-Barclays and IBM employee), Elvis Zhang (a senior developer and experienced blockchain researcher), C Wu (a specialist in wallets and exchanges) and GL Kong (an experienced blockchain engineer and early crypto adopter).\n\nThe full names and profiles of much of the JUST team is not public. However, it appears that the project shares some overlap with the TRON development team, since the platform was announced by TRON CEO and founder Justin Sun, and has received technical and financial support from TRON. \n\n\n#### What Makes JUST Unique?\n\nUnlike most other DeFi platforms, JUST isn\u2019t just looking to offer a single product that offers utility to a small subset of DeFi users. Instead, it\u2019s attempting to build an entire suite of products that cover a range of DeFi use cases, forming the foundations of a complete DeFi ecosystem on TRON. \n\nAs of January 2021, the JUST ecosystem consists of five distinct products, all of which are designed to interoperate and provide additional utility to users. \n\nThese are:\n\n\n\n*   **JustStable: **JUST\u2019s flagship decentralized multi-collateral stablecoin platform. \n*   **JustLend:** A TRON-powered money market protocol that allows users to add [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) to lending pools and take out low-interest cryptocurrency loans.\n*   **JustSwap: **An automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) platform used for trustless TRC-20 token swaps and the creation of permissionless liquidity pools. \n*   **JustLink: **The first decentralized [oracle](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) system for the TRON network \u2014 used to securely supply smart contracts with real-world data.\n*   **Cross-chain tokens:** Assets from other blockchains, including Bitcoin (BTC), [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and [Litecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/) (LTC), that have been tokenized on TRON and can be used within the JUST ecosystem.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Compound (COMP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/) \u2014 a decentralized borrowing and lending protocol built on Ethereum. \n\nCheck out [JustSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/justswap/) \u2014 the most popular [decentralized exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) on TRON.\n\nLearn about the latest crypto lingo with the CoinMarketCap [crypto glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary). \n\nStay on top of the latest announcements, crypto news, and educational articles with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many JUST (JST) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of January 2021, a total of 2.26 billion JST is in circulation, out of a maximum supply of 9.9 billion. This represents 23% of the maximum supply.\n\nThese tokens are earned by depositing, lending, and providing liquidity on the JUST Network or by completing several other actions \u2014 such as by participating in special campaigns. \n\nAccording to the original [IEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering) on Poloniex, the full JST token supply is distributed as follows:\n\n\n\n*   Seed Sale: 11%\n*   Public Sale (LaunchBase Allocation): 4%\n*   Strategic Partnerships: 26%\n*   Team: 19%\n*   Airdrop (Only for TRX Holders): 10%\n*   Ecosystem: 30%\n\nFurther information about the allocation of JST tokens, including the specifics of the vesting period for the JUST team and its inflation rate is currently unknown. However, it is known that all team tokens will be fully vested by April 2022. \n\n\n### How Is the JUST Network Secured?\n\nAs a TRC-20 token, the JUST Network is secured by the underlying TRON blockchain. \n\nUnlike other platforms that use the energy-intensive [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) mechanism to maintain the integrity of the blockchain and ward off potential [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack), TRON uses the energy-efficient delegated-proof-of-stake ([dPOS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) system.\n\nThis sees TRON (TRX) token holders elect super representatives tasked with generating blocks and packaging transactions. Together, the 27 super representatives are responsible for keeping the network secure. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy JUST (JST)?\n\nThe JUST (JST) token is highly liquid and can be traded on some of the most well-reputed exchange platforms around \u2014 including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), Poloniex, [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and Bithumb. As of January 2021, the most popular trading pairs for JST include JST/USDT, JST/KRW and JST/BTC.\n\nA handful of cryptocurrency exchanges also support direct fiat purchases of JST.
