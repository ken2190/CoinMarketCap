The world embarked upon a journey of self-discovery in 2020-2021 which has brought about many changes in the way people interact with one another. We are moved by humanity\u2019s relentless pursuit of a feeling of connectedness and we have recognized this inspiration as a call to action.\r\n\r\nThe Mello Vision\r\nThe Mello vision is of a luxurious, fully-functioning virtual reality gaming environment, wherein a plethora of fully immersive games can be played from the comfort of one's own home. This bold vision includes the integration of the Mello Token.\r\n\r\nWhat Mello Strives to Accomplish\r\nMello envisions a future where Virtual Reality (VR) is one of the centerpieces of day-to-day life. The future prevalence of VR is inevitable, but Mello intends to greatly accelerate the integration of Virtual Reality into the daily norm. Mello strives to disrupt the entertainment and finance industries. Our VR gaming environment concept is being designed to provide players, globally, with an immersive and exhilarating experience.\r\n\r\nValues and Attitudes\r\nWe at Mello espouse respect, integrity, and excellence. This means following through on our promises and regularly surpassing expectations. We are determined to provide our community with a platform that is as entertaining as it is inclusive. The Mello team is forward-thinking and infinitely determined to manifest our vision.\r\n\r\nMiraculous Beginnings From Virtually\r\nThe Mello team is composed of highly skilled and motivated individuals from all over the globe. They were brought together by a series of fantastically opportune events, and are united under a shared vision for the future of finance and entertainment. In mid-March, 2021, twelve hopeful investors in a new cryptocurrency project joined a community server.\r\n\r\nThe uniquely talented twelve were bound to find each other and realize their opportunity to \u201ccapture lightning in a bottle\" by starting their own project together. The Mello vision was put into action as quickly as it was conceived of, and the rest is history.\r\n\r\nEverything you need to know about Mello's decentralized economic system.\r\n\r\nBinance Smart Chain - The Mello Token utilizes the fast and inexpensive transactions of Binance Smart Chain.\r\n\r\nRedistributive - 3% of each Mello Transaction (outside of exchanges) is instantly distributed amongst every wallet holding Mello.\r\n\r\nLocked Liquidity - The Mello liquidity pool is locked on PancakeSwap for 1 year.\r\n\r\nSupply - When the manual burn schedule concludes, there will forever be a maximum of 402 million Mello in circulation.\r\n\r\nManual Burn Schedule - 1 million tokens burned for each of the first 10 thousand wallets until circulating supply reaches 402 million.\r\n\r\nZero Liquidity Fee - Mello charges no fee for the liquidity pool, keeping transaction costs as low as possible.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice":
