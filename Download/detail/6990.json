{"data": {"id": 6990, "name": "SUN (old)", "symbol": "SUN-OLD", "slug": "sun", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is SUN (SUN)?\r\n\r\nSUN (SUN) is a cryptocurrency designed to further the development of decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) on blockchain network TRON ([TRX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/)).\r\n\r\nDescribed as \u201cthe quintessential Bitcoin equivalent on TRON,\u201d SUN is a voluntary project which runs on TRON\u2019s TRC-20 token standard. A dedicated community administers operations via [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). \r\n\r\nSUN\u2019s genesis mining phase began at the start of September 2020, lasting for two weeks before the official launch. Participants can stake TRON\u2019s TRX token or other TRC-20 tokens to earn rewards and governance rights for SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who Are The Founders Of SUN?\r\n\r\nSUN is closely associated with TRON, and conspicuously bears the surname of TRON\u2019s founder, Justin Sun.\r\n\r\nSun is a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency community, infamous for his vocal promotion of TRON and discussing cryptocurrency with Warren Buffett at a lunch for which Sun paid $4.5 million. \r\n\r\nSun has publicly promoted SUN, and while the identities of its developers themselves have not been formally revealed, a dedicated community is tasked with its operations and growth.\r\n\r\nTrue to the DeFi mantra, all activities and updates are executed on smart contracts in accordance with community governance procedures. \r\n\r\nSUN\u2019s whitepaper calls it a \u201csocial experiment,\u201d and plans for the future state that the token \u201cmay also take part in decentralized lending, insurance, liquidity, stable coins, etc.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What Makes SUN Unique?\r\n\r\nSUN\u2019s main purpose is to exist as support for the TRON protocol, which aims to create a decentralized internet ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSUN specifically focuses on DeFi and aiding its uptake and infiltration on TRON\u2019s blockchain. As such, its function mimics that of the native tokens of DeFi platforms, and rewards users for staking other coins and involving themselves in governance procedures.\r\n\r\nIts appeal will, of course, be to existing TRON users and those familiar with DeFi staking and related activities.\r\n\r\nProfitability appears to be a question mark as of September 2020, the month of SUN\u2019s launch. According to the whitepaper, developers privilege \u201cfair\u201d token distribution and did not accept any funding, nor was any SUN reserved for them or TRON team members. \r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to TRON itself, which raised over $70 million in an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) in 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### **Related Pages**:\r\n\r\nRead more about TRON [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron).\r\n\r\nRead more about yearn.finance [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance).\r\n\r\nCrypto newbie?

This is done by staking either TRX or other tokens issued on TRON\u2019s own TRC-20 standard. \r\n\r\nTwo mining phases occurred: genesis mining, which lasted for two weeks in September 2020, and regular mining thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe genesis mining phase mined 9.34% of the total SUN supply. The total supply is 19,900,730 SUN. \r\n\r\nUser allocations of SUN depends on the amount of value they have staked and the duration of its dedication to staking. Per the whitepaper, users are free to stop staking and claim their SUN allocation at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Is the SUN Network Secured?\r\n\r\nSUN\u2019s security setup is similar to many other [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) cryptocurrencies, relying on community consensus and financial incentive to secure the network.\r\n\r\nDespite touting its similarities in ethos to [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), the token is not proof-of-work (PoW) based, and does not offer the same benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s years of openly verifiable transaction validation.\r\n\r\nPotential stakers should be aware of the risks involved in locking funds to smart contracts, despite SUN\u2019s protocol already being independently audited.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Where Can You Buy SUN (SUN)?\r\n\r\nSUN has spread to a large number of exchanges in the short time that it has been mined, with pairs available for cryptocurrencies and [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin). \r\n\r\nHuobi, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) are among the major liquidity providers. OkEx also offers USD derivatives.\r\n\r\nNew to crypto?
