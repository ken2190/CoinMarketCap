{"data": {"id": 1168, "name": "Decred", "symbol": "DCR", "slug": "decred", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Decred (DCR)?\n\nDecred (DCR) is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency launched in February 2016. The Decred token and protocol were created to facilitate open governance, community interaction, and sustainable funding policies. \n\nAccording to the [official whitepaper](https://docs.decred.org/), Decred was created in such a way that the community approves all transactions and changes made regarding the protocol. Hence, there is no way for big Decred holders to manipulate the operation of the protocol. Decred was heavily influenced by [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) and utilized many of the underlying principles of the original cryptocurrency.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Decred?\n\nThe main driving force behind the creation of Decred is an enterprise called Company 0. Its mission is to use the capabilities of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology to create better personal data protection and to bring organizational liberty to projects. \n\n[Jake Yocom-Piatt](https://twitter.com/behindtext?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is the founder and CEO of Company 0. Currently, he is serving as a project lead for the Decred project. His involvement with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology spans over more than ten years. Code written by Jake Yocom-Piatt has been used in the composition of several Bitcoin-related projects, including the creation of [Lightning Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/lightning-network) Daemon.\n\n[Marco Peereboom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-peereboom-9a32b6137/) is the chief technical officer of Company 0. He is the direct supervisor of several teams on the Decred project, including development, security, and infrastructure. Mr. Peereboom\u2019s career includes positions in companies like Dell, where he was a Senior Architect. He has been at Company 0 for more than five years, and his involvement with the Decred project is essential for the successful launch of the cryptocurrency. \n\n\n#### What Makes Decred Unique?\n\nDecred is an innovative project because it bets on blockchain technology\u2019s decentralized nature to prevent monopoly over voting status in the project itself. One of the main goals of the Decred protocol is to ensure that all DCR holders have the same amount of decision-making power and that large institutions cannot swing the votes in their favor. \n\nBy introducing ticket-holder voting, Decred ensures that people who have enough DCR will have the opportunity to participate in votes regarding the company/token\u2019s future and operations. Decred also created a dedicated voting platform called Politeia, which allows users to participate in votes, submit proposals and start discussions.\n\nNot only that, but to ensure those voting rights, Decred is employing a hybrid consensus mechanism, which combines both the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) and proof-of-stake model ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)). \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nFind out more about [XRP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/).\n\nCheck out [Curve DAO Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/).\n\nLearn more about [Decentralized networks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-decentralized-are-decentralized-networks).\n\nRead more on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Decred (DCR) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nDecred plans to issue a total of 21,000,000 tokens. Currently, about 60% of these tokens have entered circulation. \n\nOf the 21 million tokens, 8% were mined before the launch of the protocol. Half of these pre-mined coins went towards an initial airdrop, while the other half was distributed to cover costs acquired by Company 0 during the development of the protocol.  \n\nThe initial airdrop was designed to reward interested parties by giving them free Decred (DCR) tokens. Tokens were distributed among participants who had registered for the airdrop event beforehand.\n\n\n### How Is the Decred Network Secured?\n\nDecred uses a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus mechanism, which combines features of the two most popular consensus models. The cryptocurrency uses proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) to mine new blocks on the blockchain; however, miners receive only 60% of the reward after a successful mining operation.\n\nThe proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus is used in the voting organization, and it allows users to participate in the ticket-holder voting system. Voters employing the PoS consensus receive 30% of the block reward.\n\nThe remaining 10% of block rewards are stored in the [Decred Treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). Decred hosts frequent Politeia discussions and votes on how the funds from the Decred Treasury should be spent. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Decred (DCR)?\n\nThe largest marketplace for Decred (DCR) is [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), with a DCR/BTC trade volume of  USD 2,493,254. Binance is also the most popular cryptocurrency exchange for DCR/USDT transactions.\n\nOther good options for trading Decred include [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [YoBit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/yobit/), [BitAsset](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitasset/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/). It is important to note that trading cryptocurrency involves risks, like any other investment. \n\n[Read more here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about how to buy
