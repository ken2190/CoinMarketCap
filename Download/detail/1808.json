{"data": {"id": 1808, "name": "OMG Network", "symbol": "OMG", "slug": "omg", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is OMG Network (OMG)?\n\nOMG Network, formerly known as OmiseGo, is a non-custodial, layer-2 scaling solution built for the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). As an Ethereum scaling solution, OMG Network is designed to allow users to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens significantly faster and cheaper than when transacting directly on the Ethereum network. \n\nThe network is based on a novel scaling solution called MoreViable Plasma, which uses a sidechain architecture to group several transactions off-chain into a batch, which can then be verified as a single transaction on the Ethereum root chain. According to OMG Network, this technology has the potential to scale [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) to thousands of transactions per second (TPS) \u2014 instead of the 10 to 14 tps Ethereum 1.0 is currently capable of. \n\nThe network is powered by the OMG utility token, which can be used as one of the payment methods for fees on the OMG Network, and will eventually be stakable \u2014 helping to secure the network in return for rewards. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of OMG Network?\n\nThe OMG Network currently consists of a team of more than 50 employees scattered across the world. It was founded by Thai-born Vansa Chatikavanij and operates as a subsidiary of SYNQA \u2014 a Thailand-based fintech firm that was formerly known as Omise Holdings.\n\nAs the projector founder, Vansa Chatikavanij received a master\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences at New York's Columbia University. Following this, Chatikavanij held several consulting roles at prominent financial institutions including the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and World Bank Group, before founding OMG Network (then OmiseGo) in 2017. \n\nChatikavanij held the role of managing director at the company until 2019, before transitioning to the role of CEO, which she still holds to this day. Beyond this, Stephen McNamara \u2014 former head of blockchain R&D strategy at Huawei Technologies \u2014 is OMG Network's COO, whereas Kasima Tharnpipitchai, a heavily experienced engineer and consultant, is its CTO. \n\n\n## What Makes OMG Network Unique?\n\nOMG Network believes that Ethereum\u2019s significant speed and cost barriers will need to be overcome before mainstream businesses will consider building their products and applications on the network. \n\nAs such, the OMG Network project is built to help make Ethereum more attractive to businesses and projects that want to scale while simultaneously cutting down on their carbon footprint. It achieves this with its plasma-based sidechain solution, which can help reduce electricity usage by up to 99% compared to Ethereum and cut fees by around two thirds, while ensuring assets remain secured by the underlying Ethereum network. \n\nThe platform itself is supported by $25 million in funding obtained during its 2017 initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)). Moreover, OMG Network parent firm SYNQA recently raised a further $80 million in Series C funding \u2014 and was supported by several major investment firms, including Toyota Financial Services Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\n\n\n### Relevant Pages\n\nRead about [Stellar](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/) \u2014 one of OMG Network's biggest contenders.\n\nFind out more about [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/) \u2014 a high-speed smart-contract capable blockchain.\n\nTake a deep dive into Ethereum 2.0 with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0).\n\nStay on top of the latest trends with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n## How Many OMG Network (OMG) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nLike most [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), OMG Network tokens have a fixed maximum supply. This is set at exactly 140,245,398 OMG and will never increase beyond this point. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, this total supply has already been fully minted, with the majority already in active circulation. \n\nOf the total supply, 65.1% of tokens were distributed to investors and 5% were distributed in an airdrop, whereas the last 29.9% is held by the project and team. Of this 29.9%, 20% is locked in the OMG Network reserve smart contract for funding future developments and network validation, and the remaining 9.9% is reserved for the founding team.\n\nBoth the OMG reserve and team allocation were locked for one year, but this has since elapsed. \n\n\n## How Is OMG Network Secured?\n\nThe OMG Network mainnet will eventually move to a [proof-of-stake (POS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) consensus system, which will allow users to stake their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards. \n\nUntil then, OMG Network child chains are secured by a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which is basically a simplified form of proof-of-stake which is controlled by a single block producer (OMG Network itself) for now \u2014 which essentially stakes its reputation on staying honest. \n\nOMG Network plans to transition to proof-of-stake as soon as it\u2019s ready, following which OMG holders will be able to become stakeholders in the success and security of the network, by delegating their [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) to validators. \n\n\n## Where Can You Buy OMG Network (OMG) Tokens?\n\nOMG tokens are highly liquid and can be purchased or traded on well over 200 different exchange platforms, including several top 10 exchanges \u2014 such as [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) and [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/). Some of the most popular trading pairs include OMG/USDT, OMG/BTC and OMG/ETH.\n\nOMG can also be traded against several fiat currencies, including U.S. dollars (USD), euros (EUR) and British pound sterling (GBP).
