{"data": {"id": 10201, "name": "BitBook", "symbol": "BBT", "slug": "bitbook", "category": "token", "description": "More than 1.3 billion people travel every year around the world.The hotel industry is worth $528 billion annually, and is expected to double by 2030.\r\n. 90% of the booking market is currently dominated by 2 major platforms\r\n. Because hotels are completely dependent on these sites, fighting high commission fees has\r\nbecome the industry\u2019s biggest challenge. Trying to compete with these corporate giants would be a lost cause. The intelligent way is to play another game entirely. Based on these very simple observations, we identified an enormous opportunity for a Crypto business to take this battle on, so we created BitBook.\r\n\r\nBitBook is the travel platform where people can book accommodation and earn tokens in the process. With our Token Reward program, not only will we drive adoption of the platform by incentivizing users to bring their friends onboard, but also we drive organic traffic by rewarding users who create remarkable travel content.\r\n\r\nThe creation of BitBook Token is what allows us to bring this project from a concept to a platform that will be able to disrupt the current market leaders. Our initial target market stretches across two huge industries: the hotel industry, valued at $528 billion and the crypto industry valued at $2 trillion.\r\n.\r\nOther crypto companies make the mistake of not having a solid working growth model. BitBook, on the contrary, is built with a focus on growth where everyone benefits: users are rewarded with tokens when they use our platform, and accommodation providers benefit from a lower commission structure solving their biggest challenge.\r\n\r\nBitBook\u2019s business model will be split into three different revenue streams:\r\n- Competitive commission model for every booking made on the BitBook platform.\r\n- Affiliate Marketing to sell third party products (Insurance, flights, car hire etc)\r\n- Advertisement to enable our partners to offer relevant products and services.\r\n100% of the revenue streams will be used to buy back tokens from the market, they will then be burned, decreasing the total circulating supply which will drive up the value of the BitBook token.\r\nAfter IEO completion, 100% of the circulating supply will be sold and available to the open market.The strategy set out above is drawn from years of working in the travel industry, from business travel booking platform, to having worked with the biggest hotel chains. After extensive experience in Crypto and over a year of listing projects on KuCoin exchange, we now have the exact blueprint and knowledge on how to execute on our business plan. \r\n\r\nFrom the same co-founding team of VPNresellers, our team, comprised of marketing and sales experts, along with solid engineering expertise, makes us a powerhouse for success.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to enable more people to experience the world.
