We plan on building our Cyber Milfs collection matching that of CyberPunks. \r\n\r\nDespite having been around for so many years, cryptocurrency is finally getting the traction it needs to become something that is viable in today\u2019s mainstream market. Digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are becoming widely accepted, by not only the general population but also by credible and dominant business magnates in every sector of the present-day economy. \r\n\r\nThe Non-Fungible Token phenomena is still new to mainstream media and the public eye in general. Likewise, the majority of the traffic and popularity began stemming within the last year. $MILF Token is on the fore-front of this new endeavor with a purpose to introduce new patrons to the NFT world with a one of a kind theme as well as avoiding the hassle an individual normally would have to undertake when attempting to acquire NFTs themselves on the open market. \r\n\r\nJust as an individual would invest in the significant value of a stock or cryptocurrency to own some portion of it, the idea behind $MILF Token is no different. Yet, $MILF Token supersedes all other tokens by the fact that after owning a specific amount of $MILF token (to be determined) for a set period of time (to be determined), the consumer will be given their own \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d piece of digital NFT art as well. This NFT will be conveniently airdropped directly to the consumer\u2019s wallet. The consumer\u2019s duty is just to hold onto $MILF token, as well as their NFT portfolio, and watch as the profits of both grow together. \r\n\r\nPeriodically, more and more of these \u201cCyber MILF\u201d NFTs will be airdropped to the consumer, all completely different from one another in design and varying in rarity. The more $MILF tokens you own and hold. the more NFT you will be rewarded. Your NFT collection will be unlike any other you will see on the open market. \r\n\r\nBridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and NFTs are made quick and simple with $MILF token. Hopefully, you\u2019ll see the opportunity for growth and join us on this exciting new chapter of the cryptocurrency era. Thank you and welcome to the Future.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-03T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "184", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-12T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://milftoken.net"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0x0dd1989e4b0e82f154b729ff47f8c9a4f4b2cc1c#balances"], "source_code": ["https://etherscan.io/address/0x0dd1989e4b0e82f154b729ff47f8c9a4f4b2cc1c#code"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/milf_coin"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/MilfToken"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.95012133608962, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.14534198, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.67063994}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.35385261564175, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.42971627, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.53591158}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04597065485341, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.9713895, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.70390874}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08818568964251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.68090104, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.9905728}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.85315809919322, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.59097836, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50061523}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884704433161, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.2284312, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.45313593}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:51:00.398Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "27", "credit_count": 0}}
