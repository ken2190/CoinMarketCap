{"data": {"id": 8423, "name": "Public Mint", "symbol": "MINT", "slug": "public-mint", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Public Mint (MINT)?\n\nPublic Mint\u2019s primary goal is to bridge the gap between crypto and [fiat](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fiat) currencies. It offers a fully collateralized, regulated and FDIC-insured platform for synthetic fiat currencies.\n\nPublic Mint also offers a fiat-native blockchain, APIs and an embeddable web widget. It allows developers to build fiat-enabled applications that accept credit cards, ACH, wire transfers and more. Public Mint launched in 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Public Mint?\n\nThe founders of Public Mint are Halsey Minor, founder of CNET and Uphold and co-founder at Salesforce, and Jorge Pereira, former CTO at Uphold and current CTO at Public Mint. The company\u2019s CEO is Paulo Rodrigues, former Head of a Swift bureau and CEO at a blockchain R&D center\n\n\n#### What Makes Public Mint Unique?\n\nPublic Mint allows users to transact with tokens pegged to fiat currencies. The platform offers a fiat-native blockchain where users can deposit fiat currencies to tokenize them for later use on the Public Mint network. It combines the price stability of fiat currencies and blockchain\u2019s 24/7 accessibility, global reach and efficiency.\n\nThe Public Mint blockchain connects two distinct off-chain and on-chain domains. Users can operate each of the domains with different scopes, requirements and limitations. \n\nAt the network level, Public Mint combines a traditional client-server model with an Ethereum-compatible blockchain. The system connects with custodial partners and KYC providers to ensure compliance with beneficial regulations. The platform makes sure that the minting and burning of on-chain tokenized fiat assets corresponds to the respective changes in funds held in the custodial layer.\n\nThe Public Mint ecosystem consists of three layers. The multi-custodial layer is represented by Custodial Partners \u2014 licensed financial institutions that hold custody over fiat funds at a 1:1 ratio to the tokenized assets.\n\nThe blockchain layer, based on Hyperledger Besu, is an enterprise-grade Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) client.  However, the Public Mint platform is independent of Ethereum, as it controls its own transactional logic and the deployment and maintenance of blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThe Smart Services layer comprises the smart contracts that add functionality on top of the blockchain foundation. Public Mint handles state changes similarly to the Ethereum Virtual Machine ([EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)). Smart contracts can be written in any Ethereum-compatible language.\n\nPublic Mint also has a liquidity rewards program, allowing liquidity providers to earn MINT tokens.\n\n\n#### Related
