{"data": {"id": 10894, "name": "StorX Network", "symbol": "SRX", "slug": "storx-network", "category": "token", "description": "About StorX\r\n\r\nStorX is a decentralized cloud storage network, which empowers users to store their data securely on the cloud. Each file uploaded on StorX is split and encrypted into multiple fragments to autonomous storage nodes operated by individual operators across the world. Designed as the collection of autonomous storage networks, no individual operator has complete access to your data. StorX is not only faster compared to legacy centralized storage providers but also allows users to save substantial amounts on costs compared to a centralized cloud. StorX enables users with spare storage capacity to lease space and earn fabulous returns.\r\n\r\nFeatures of StorX:\r\n\r\nGreater Security - StorX is based on XinFin\u2019s blockchain platform and inherits its advanced security features, including immutability and consensus. Additionally, it features end-to-end encryption and as data stored on the network is split into encrypted fragments among storage nodes, individual host/operator will never be able to access the data or manipulate it. \r\n\r\n100% Anonymity and Privacy - StorX encrypts and shreds your data into tiny fragments and distributes it across a decentralized network. The hosts store a fragmented copy of your file on their node and have no way of knowing the content of your files or its owner and only you hold the decryption keys that can assemble and retrieve your encrypted files.\r\n\r\nValue for Money - There is a great level of competition among host nodes competing to store data ensuring fair prices to every user and with a vast pool of nodes to choose from, the amount of storage available becomes significantly higher which in turn reduces the cost to store data. Not only is StorX superior compared to centralized cloud storage services in terms of features, but it also offers the best value for money at a fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\nFaster Speeds - Due to the decentralized architecture of StorX, encrypted copies of your data are stored across multiple regions, ensuring faster retrieval speeds.\r\n\r\nHighly Redundant - StorX stores redundant data fragments of files on multiple storage nodes spread around the world. It eliminates any single point of failure as your data exists on multiple nodes and offers a high uptime that competes with the uptime offered by centralized cloud storage services.\r\n\r\nReliability - The duplication of data across multiple storage nodes across multiple geographical regions protects from incidents such as outages, system failures, or any hacks and malware attacks that could compromise data servers.\r\n\r\nOpen-Source - StorX utilizes open-source software for its platform to ensure complete transparency. Open standards and used and supported as much as possible and users are not locked into any proprietary formats. You can import and export anything.\r\n\r\nCommunity Development - StorX offers a growing list of the latest features to its users that has been developed by a growing number of community contributors that consist of leading software engineers.\r\n\r\nEnvironmentally Friendly - A decentralized network utilizes the spare storage already available around the world instead of building large data centers that consume a lot of energy to store data. This makes StorX more environmentally friendly compared to centralized cloud storage solutions.\r\n\r\nStorX aims to leverage the world\u2019s surplus data storage to create a platform that is ready to disrupt the $100 billion cloud storage industry with a solution that not only is more secure, private, and faster but also environmentally friendly at the fraction of the cost of centralized cloud storage services. It provides an alternative to those who want to break free from the monotony of centralized cloud service providers and their exploitative market practices and offers a solution that is built by the community, for the community.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:54:36.000Z", "watchCount": "551", "dateLaunched": "2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [{"slug": "storage", "name": "Storage", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://storx.tech", "https://storx.io"], "technical_doc": ["https://storx.tech/storx_whitepaper_v1.pdf"], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://github.com/StorXNetwork"], "message_board": ["https://storxnetwork.medium.com"], "chat": ["https://t.me/StorXNetwork", "https://discord.gg/ha4Jufj2Nm"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/StorXNetwork"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/StorXNetwork"]}, "volume": 336040.01723265, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -16.751, "statistics": {"price": 0.92038414856956, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.00188479, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.70208544, "priceChangePercentage7d": 109.03315763, "priceChangePercentage30d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 1380576222.85, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 1500000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 3072, "low24h": 0.80015682, "high24h": 0.92609648, "low7d": 0.0, "high7d": 0.98912888, "low30d": 0.0, "high30d": 0.98912888, "low90d": 0.0, "high90d": 0.98912888, "low52w": 0.0, "high52w": 0.98912888, "lowAllTime": 0.0, "highAllTime": 0.98912888, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 0, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -6.95, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-21T09:43:06.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-30T03:41:07.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.73170611, "highYesterday": 0.98912888, "openYesterday": 0.94524584, "closeYesterday": 0.91529941, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -3.17, "volumeYesterday": 348838.42, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 46.15277603529009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.97491332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 52.15383074}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.34961053638639, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.48844037, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65699839}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04606059556592, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.60454635, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.52026324}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35073162374456, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.29500189, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.00533147}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08805508567185, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49406181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.66853882}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33953608915345, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.35932698, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.52614735}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.81208358366918, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.33740637, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.63805644}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884983830176, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.8379087, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.06023177}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05089512649492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.3618099, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01964124}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 433, "name": "Bitrue", "slug": "bitrue"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:55:42.523Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
