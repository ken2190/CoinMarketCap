{"data": {"id": 6432, "name": "ECOMI", "symbol": "OMI", "slug": "ecomi", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is ECOMI (OMI)?\n\nECOMI is a Singapore-based technology company in the digitible collectible space. The company has created VeVe, a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based digital collectibles marketplace, for users to buy and share their collectibles across the social network service. \n\nECOMI is made up of two different elements: the former ECOMI Collect ecosystem (now known as VeVe) and the ECOMI Secure Storage Wallet. VeVe contains the VeVe store, a second-hand market, an augmented reality showroom and a social feed. \n\nVeVe works with brands including Batman, Superman, Harley Quinn, Ghostbuster, NFL and MLB, along with others. \n\nThe OMI token is a utility token that is used as a medium of exchange when a user buys, sells or trades their digital collectibles on the VeVe platform. OMI also ensures the immutable record of ownership for the digital collectibles. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of ECOMI?\n\nDavid Yu is the CEO of ECOMI. He founded his first business in 1996, and has since started various businesses across the license and retail industry. Daniel Crothers and Joseph Janik are the other two co-founders of ECOMI.\n\n\n#### What Makes ECOMI Unique?\n\nECOMI allows users to both buy and sell digital collectibles, as well as show off their items with VeVe\u2019s social media aspect. VeVe also has brand partnerships with well-known licensors in the traditional collectors market, as mentioned, including many D.C. characters like Batman and Wonder Woman.\n\nVeVe allows users to create virtual showrooms to share their collectibles with other users globally, both on their phones and in augmented reality form that allows you to physically walk around these virtual settings. The augmented reality of VeVe means that you can also place your collectibles around you in AR.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Chiliz](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chiliz/) fan tokens.\n\nLearn more about [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token).\n\nDiscover the world of [MyNeighborAlice](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/myneighboralice/).\n\nCheck out the CoinMarketCap [blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many ECOMI (OMI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe OMI token was first sold in an initial exchange offering on Bitforex as part of the private/pre-sale round, with a hard cap of 1,500 BTC. In every stage of the fundraising process, one OMI was equal to 1 satoshi. \n\nThe [total supply](https://medium.com/ecomi/getting-started-with-the-omi-token-metrics-and-details-d2b366a49be0) of OMI is 750 billion: 20% of the total supply was available during the OMI sales, equivalent to 150 billion OMI. \n\nWithin the [VeVe tokenomic system](https://medium.com/ecomi/ve-ve-tokenomics-in-app-funds-and-token-buybacks-7ea8ac1a19c9?source=collection_home---2------4-----------------------), about 40% (or 300 billion OMI) are held in the in-app reserve.\n\n\n### How Is the ECOMI Network Secured?\n\nThe OMI token is a GO20 token, meaning that it is built on the GoChain blockchain. GoChain is a scalable, decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). GoChain is also completely backwards compatible with the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy ECOMI (OMI)?\n\nYou can buy OMI on several exchanges, including AscendEX (Bitmax), BitForex and Gate.io.\n\nFor more information on buying cryptocurrency with fiat, check out [CoinMarketCap\u2019s guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).", "dateAdded": "2020-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:13:05.000Z", "watchCount": "115909", "tags": [{"slug": "collectibles-nfts", "name": "Collectibles & NFTs", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "dao-maker", "name": "DAO Maker", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "exnetwork-capital-portfolio", "name": "Exnetwork Capital Portfolio", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "166251551198", "urls": {"website": ["https://www.ecomi.com/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://explorer.gochain.io/addr/0x5347FDeA6AA4d7770B31734408Da6d34a8a07BdF"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": [], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/ecomi_"]}, "volume": 2711766.03713382, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -12.6117, "statistics": {"price": 0.00246289044365, "priceChangePercentage1h": 1.62162653, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.30381216, "priceChangePercentage7d": -16.21183743, "priceChangePercentage30d": 11.63612263, "priceChangePercentage60d": -7.20965946, "priceChangePercentage90d": -59.35613349, "marketCap": 409543759.94, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 2.3038, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 1847167832.74, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 42.51, "circulatingSupply": 166285821196.0, "totalSupply": 750000000000.0, "maxSupply": 750000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0252, "rank": 224, "low24h": 0.00231504, "high24h": 0.0024832, "low7d": 0.00226199, "high7d": 0.0029738, "low30d": 0.00226199, "high30d": 0.00487879, "low90d": 0.00114373, "high90d": 0.00624826, "low52w": 6.767e-05, "high52w": 0.0133765, "lowAllTime": 6.767e-05, "highAllTime": 0.0133765, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 3539.56, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -81.59, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-14T09:43:46.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-03-19T17:34:04.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.00231504, "highYesterday": 0.00247522, "openYesterday": 0.00247244, "closeYesterday": 0.00239681, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -3.06, "volumeYesterday": 2445727.2, "turnover": 0.00662143, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 4279, "name": "Swipe", "slug": "swipe", "price": 2.05032573819226, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.35220244, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.41110489}, {"id": 693, "name": "Verge", "slug": "verge", "price": 0.02291022755675, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.85788917, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.64897514}, {"id": 1, "name": "Bitcoin", "slug": "bitcoin", "price": 41766.58008262508, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.08077319, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.05483587}, {"id": 1934, "name": "Loopring", "slug": "loopring", "price": 0.2570108304304, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13413044, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.64610399}, {"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.91175222418891, "priceChangePercentage24h": 40.52515552, "priceChangePercentage7d": 57.81047971}, {"id": 6536, "name": "MANTRA DAO", "slug": "mantra-dao", "price": 0.13461600924622, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.10752848, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.84683489}, {"id": 2313, "name": "SIRIN LABS Token", "slug": "sirin-labs-token", "price": 0.01159001784146, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.88589765, "priceChangePercentage7d": 28.19704603}, {"id": 1772, "name": "Storj", "slug": "storj", "price": 1.03114333884787, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13767378, "priceChangePercentage7d": 28.48634348}, {"id": 7278, "name": "Aave", "slug": "aave", "price": 320.57796060406775, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.36365131, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.18021576}, {"id": 6187, "name": "Serum", "slug": "serum", "price": 3.91387977691422, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.56350145, "priceChangePercentage7d": 35.35759359}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 302, "name": "Gate.io", "slug": "gate-io"}, {"id": 403, "name": "BitForex", "slug": "bitforex"}, {"id": 453, "name": "AscendEX (Bitmax)", "slug": "ascendex"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:13:41.289Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "27", "credit_count": 0}}
