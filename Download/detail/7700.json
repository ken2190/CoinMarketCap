{"data": {"id": 7700, "name": "WAY-F coin", "symbol": "WAYF", "slug": "way-f-coin", "category": "coin", "description": "What is the WAY-F coin? (WAYF)\r\n\r\nThe WAY-F coin was launched in 2020 and its main goal is to ensure the anonymity and confidentiality of transactions of all members of the WAY-F network.\r\n\r\nThe team of the WAY-F coin has many years of experience in project development and implementation, as well as various solutions in the field of cryptovrency and block technology. The coin is based on the Bitcoin Blockchain and has been improved by a factor of 10, based on the acute problems in the crypto industry today. The WAY-F coin is open source, so anyone can take it and make their own cryptographic currency based on the WAY-F blockchain. Thanks to the advanced blockage solutions and developments and their successful application in the WAY-F coin, the coin is the benchmark for technical implementation for many cryptovalues and is several times superior to Dash, Monero and ZCash.\r\n\r\nEven today the WAY-F coin is used as an anonymous method of payment for goods and services all over the world. One of the first and key ways to use the coin today is the Close of Credit program - which allows you to officially close overdue bank debts for the WAY-F coin at a discount of up to 70%. As stated by the team in the program Close of Credit already involved citizens of 8 countries: Russia, Germany, France, Indonesia, Thailand, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and this is just the beginning.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the WAY-F coin unique?\r\n\r\nThe WAY-F coin has several features that make the coin unique. One of the main features is full anonymity thanks to GCPT technology, which provides an absolutely new level of anonymity. Any information inside the system remains completely hidden from the public without the possibility of any bypass method existing in the world.\r\n\r\nThanks to the built-in ALPHADEEPSEND messenger, together with a transaction you can always attach a text message of up to 1,000,000 characters with multi-step data encryption. The level of encryption of sender and recipient data is dozens of times higher than all existing resources.\r\n\r\nThe coin team took care of the network bandwidth back at the start, applying advanced solutions to date, such as Adaptive Block Size and VRX Algorithm, which provide consistently fast transaction processing speed.\r\n\r\nA unique feature is also that mining through the software purse is conducted in parallel using two algorithms Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake. Network members can always choose the most convenient and profitable algorithm of mining. PoW mining is based on the most advanced algorithm currently available - X11, which is radically different from the algorithm used in Bitcoin SHA-256. The x11 algorithm is ASIC-resistant, which is the primary reason for centralization of network blocks and attacks 51% today.\r\n\r\nTRUECONNECT technology ensures organic integration of the coin on any trading floor and platform as a means of fully anonymous payments and transfers. It is important that the technical component of the coin is fully ready for use in the DarkNet network. Besides, there are also a lot of trading platforms and platforms on the Internet, where the anonymity of data and payments between the consumer and the seller, as well as in relation to third parties is required.\r\nAll these features make the WAY-F coin an anonymous payment tool with high bandwidth, which has no analogues in the market.\r\n\r\nWhere can I buy the WAY-F coin (WAYF)?\r\n\r\nYou can always buy coins on the official WAYFcoin.com website as well as on the ToTheMoney.com platform. Despite the fact that the launch of WAY-F coin took place only recently, today the coin is already traded on the 4 largest exchanges according to CoinMarketCap. This list includes: European exchange Coinsbit, Chinese exchange BigOne, Canadian exchange Biconomy and Russian exchange PrizmBit. The coin is available for trading in pairs with USDT and RUB.", "dateAdded": "2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T09:21:06.000Z", "watchCount": "613", "tags": [], "selfReportedCirculatingSupply": "2100000.0", "urls": {"website": ["https://wayfcoin.com/"], "technical_doc": ["https://goo.su/0juM"], "explorer": ["https://explorer.wayfcoin.com/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/wayfcoin/source"], "message_board": ["https://t.me/wayf_coin", "https://vk.com/wayfcoin"], "chat": [], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/wayfcoin"]}, "volume": 897.8215003, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 52.2218, "statistics": {"price": 0.4502525026094, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.02050999, "priceChangePercentage24h": -25.01280565, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.22857206, "priceChangePercentage30d": -27.53955102, "priceChangePercentage60d": 94.37223554, "priceChangePercentage90d": 1057.17740048, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 54030300.31, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": -47.33, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 6200000.0, "maxSupply": 120000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4633, "low24h": 0.45006828, "high24h": 0.64578861, "low7d": 0.29018814, "high7d": 0.8767618, "low30d": 0.29018814, "high30d": 1.797486, "low90d": 0.03739383, "high90d": 1.797486, "low52w": 0.02189792, "high52w": 1.797486, "lowAllTime": 0.02189792, "highAllTime": 1.797486, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 1956.14, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -74.95, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-03-26T16:56:06.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-06T06:23:07.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.42506041, "highYesterday": 0.64578861, "openYesterday": 0.55495431, "closeYesterday": 0.62024829, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 11.77, "volumeYesterday": 1470.54, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.37667026528583, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.09947235, "priceChangePercentage7d": 56.04698342}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.23417068186519, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.61093021, "priceChangePercentage7d": 21.26213566}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04635900344899, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.42583319, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.99613334}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36973595307515, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.78815833, "priceChangePercentage7d": 27.39068341}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08927305242364, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.83172181, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.47593733}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.37888754685495, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.05865856, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.08685691}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.60164177705228, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.29577862, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.74268976}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12853543270797, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.33401947, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.31084152}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05121059682666, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.36196388, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.70454006}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:22:25.469Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "258", "credit_count": 0}}
