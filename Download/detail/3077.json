{"data": {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "symbol": "VET", "slug": "vechain", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is VeChain (VET)?\r\n\r\nVeChain (VET) is a blockchain-powered supply chain platform. Begun in 2015 and launched in June 2016, VeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create an ecosystem which solves some of the major problems with supply chain management.\r\n\r\nThe platform uses two in-house tokens, VET and [VTHO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vethor-token/), to manage and create value based on its VeChainThor public blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to boost the efficiency, traceability and transparency of supply chains while reducing costs and placing more control in the hands of individual users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of VeChain (VET)?\r\n\r\nVeChain is the product of creator and co-founder Sunny Lu, an IT executive who was formerly CIO of Louis Vuitton China. \r\n\r\nLu has since become a well-known name within the cryptocurrency industry. He has drawn attention to the ability of blockchain technology to solve transparency in particular, arguing that it can create \u201ctrust-free\u201d structures which do not suffer from corruption as part of the supply chain.\r\n\r\nFellow co-founder Jay Zhang, who directs VeChain's global corporate structure, governance, and financial management, previously worked for both Deloitte and PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the finance and risk management sphere. \r\n\r\nHaving launched in June 2016, VeChain is one of the oldest dedicated blockchain supply chain platforms on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What Makes VeChain (VET) Unique?\r\n\r\nVeChain exists to disrupt traditional supply chain models, an industry which before blockchain had remained little changed over the decades.\r\n\r\nUsing transparent technology with no single point of weakness or control allows for greater security, efficiency and ease of tracking products in a given supply chain, while reducing cost through trustless automation.\r\n\r\nVeChain\u2019s model thus appeals to businesses looking to reduce supply chain friction and give a more transparent impression to clients.\r\n\r\nVeChain\u2019s official literature notes that its unique proposition lies in its dual-token setup, among other features. In-house token fees combine with charges for various services to generate operating income for the company, while token holders can engage in activities such as staking, thus providing liquidity in return for rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### **Related Pages**:\r\n\r\nRead more about Orchid [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orchid/).\r\n\r\nRead more about PIVX [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pivx/).\r\n\r\nNew to cryptocurrency? Check out [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics), CoinMarketCap\u2019s dedicated education suite.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### How Many VeChain (VET) Coins Are There In Circulation?\r\n\r\nVeChain has two in-house tokens: VeChain (VET) and VeThor (VTHO). Described as a unique offering for such a platform, the dual-token system is designed to avoid fee fluctuations and network congestion.\r\n\r\nVET is the token used for transactions and other activities, while VTHO provides fee payments and thus functions as a \u201cgas token,\u201d similar to how [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) functions for Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) transactions.\r\n\r\nVET holders automatically generate a small amount of passive income in VTHO, while 70% of the VTHO used in a VET payment is destroyed. \r\n\r\nVTHO is generated based on VET holdings, while VET itself has a maximum fixed supply of 86,712,634,466 tokens. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### How Is the VeChain (VET) Network Secured?\r\n\r\nVeChain (VET) is a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) token, and VeChain itself explains that relatively low computing power is required to achieve network security and maintain user consensus. \r\n\r\nA separate feature, [proof-of-authority](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa), involves authority masternode operators maintaining the protocol in their own interest according to rules laid down by parent organization, the VeChain Foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Where Can You Buy VeChain (VET)?\r\n\r\nVET is a freely-tradable token available on major exchanges, while markets also exist for VTHO.\r\n\r\nVET had major markets on Binance and Huobi Global among other platforms, with pairs for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re new to cryptocurrency and want to know how to buy Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) or any
