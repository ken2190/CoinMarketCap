At Laksmi we believe that any kind of financial decentralisation can only be achieved if we can make fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat conversion super easy. Without seamless crypto-fiat conversion financial decentralisation is nothing but a piped dream.\r\n\r\nLaksmi is the next generation P2P Crypto exchange driven by Crypto Agents Network (CAN) in the physical world.  That is buyers- sellers can just walk in a crypto agent's store and transact crypto over the counter. Opening the doors of crypto world to billions of people. People who are not educated, tech savvy or are just old. Thus, widening the reach of crypto to people hitherto untouched. \r\n\r\nApart from introducing offline transactions through CAN, Laksmi also disrupts the online P2P crypto exchanges with its hybrid approach. Hybrid approach where the convenience and user experience is that of a CEX and privacy of the P2P exchange. \r\nThere is just one price on the Laksmi P2P exchange for Bitcoin and other crypto thus removing all the confusion associated with P2P exchanges. It is designed like CEX where users see the order book for chosen payment mode rather than advertisements by other traders on the platform. This allows them to buy or sell with confidence without bothering about the profile of the trader. Platform fees is half of the competition and which can be further reduced by staking Laksmi Tokens. Platform thus keeps user at the core and endeavours to make the experience simple and convenient. \r\n\r\nApart from buy and sell crypto, users can stake Laksmi Tokens and other crypto and earn interest. Users can use Laksmi platform to remit cross border payments and donate in the form of crypto for the causes they feel strong about.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-25T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "12", "dateLaunched": "2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.35, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.laksmi.live"], "technical_doc": ["https://laksmi-token.gitbook.io/laksmi-exchange/"], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://laksmiex.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/Laksmiexchange_Group", "https://t.me/Laksmiexchange"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/LaksmiEx"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.99195551596571, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.37778497, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.76126544}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33076201801208, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.46531284, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.96789566}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04600186231469, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.14868791, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.17285939}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35225527622235, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.11423849, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.42822185}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08804213776288, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.49769861, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.56837823}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3483481875156, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.45162233, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.05712907}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.82545567829481, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.69671449, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.87444725}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.1291243021993, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.62706083, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.22580141}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0504277483724, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.40139621, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.80158625}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:53:42.782Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
