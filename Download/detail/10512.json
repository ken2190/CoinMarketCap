{"data": {"id": 10512, "name": "SAFETREES", "symbol": "TREES", "slug": "safetrees", "category": "token", "description": "SAFETREES is a decentralized eco-friendly community-based project that aims to compensate the\r\nefforts of those supporting in saving the environment notably tree growers in rural communities\r\nand environmental groups. Its deflationary native token TREES is on Binance Smart Chain, boasting\r\nseveral impressive features. It is the first token with ultimate purpose and tangible product i.e. SafeTrees App tree-tracker and a Tree adoption marketplace where tree adoption would take place. \r\n\r\nThe TREES token is a sustainable carbon credit incentive utility token for tree farmer or tree-planting organization\u2019s ecological impact and contribution to curbing the effects of environmental imbalance. It is a digital asset created to compensate for greenhouse gases emission and providing more convenient alternatives to reducing one's fossil fuel consumption.\r\n\r\nIn addition, by investing in the TREES token, holders will reap rewards through a static reflection\r\nmechanism built-in to the smart contract algorithm, so token holders are guaranteed to watch their\r\nwallet grow indefinitely.\r\n\r\nSOLVING THIS PROBLEM\r\nDeforestation impacted Global Environmental Balance. Efforts for planting and tending trees is\r\nreduced due to the lack of direct financial incentives especially in many rural communities around\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nGrowing trees is a long-term project and after several years of tending hundreds or even thousands\r\nof trees, the growers can only then rip the financial benefits from tree planting. During those tree\r\ntending years, the growers especially in many rural communities are unaware that their trees have\r\nalso sequestered tons of CO2 \u2013 that benefits everyone on the planet. However, tree growers are not\r\nfinancially compensated for their efforts to providing carbon offset and ecological benefits to our\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nWith SAFETREES cross-platform mobile and blockchain technology, we will reverse this scenario. We\r\nwill give awareness, direct financial incentives and more benefits to those silent heroes who are\r\ndoing a tremendous effort in fighting environmental degradation. SAFETREES use a novel mobile\r\napplication with a tree-tracking algorithm that allows tree growers and individuals app users to take\r\ngeotagged images of their trees which automatically measures the tree attributes, register the GPS\r\ncoordinates, and assigns a unique tag or number to the tree and stored the data into the blockchain\r\nas tokenized or minted information.\r\n\r\nLearn more:
