{"data": {"id": 9944, "name": "Cubfinance", "symbol": "CUB", "slug": "cubfinance", "category": "token", "description": "Cubfinance is a yield farming & staking platform on BSC, built by Leofinance a two year old community with six other dApps and thousands of members. \r\n\r\nLeoFinance has been operating a wide number of projects in the crypto industry for 2 years now and we'll continue to do so for the next 2 years and beyond. A long-term outlook is one of the unique values that our community brings to the DeFi / Yield Farming space through Cub Finance.\r\n\r\nLeofinance, the parent of Cubfinance, is an Established Project with a 2 Year Track Record of Building Blockchain-Based Applications. DeFi Yield Farming apps are a dime a dozen these days. Cub Finance is different because it is built as a branch of our LeoFi organization underneath the LeoFinance project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Cub Finance is to adopt and build DeFi-based smart contracts for the entire LeoFinance project. Through BEP20 LEO (bLEO), CUB and the adoption of existing use cases in the space, we're using the basic starting point of the Cub Finance yield platform to build a new generation of DeFi apps to expand and service our community of thousands of MAUs.\r\n\r\nAs our platform matures, you'll see us quickly adopt the successful smart contracts of other platforms and modify them to service CUB and bLEO hodlers. Contracts like layered farming, collateralized loans, long-term token lock vaults and more have all found their way onto our roadmap for LeoFi.\r\nLaunched in July 2019, LeoFinance started as a platform for crypto and finance content creators. Our flagship application - LeoFinance.io - connects the community on a web3 social media platform. Think of it as being similar to the popular Web2 blogging application \"Medium\" but on the blockchain. \r\n\r\nOur Mission\r\nOur mission is to continuously expand the core user base of the LeoFinance project and bring value to the existing user base. \r\nThe best marketing in the crypto space is collaboration and interoperability. Our aim is to build new applications to service a wider audience within the crypto industry and CubFinance is one of our latest projects to roll out. \r\n\r\nLearn More\r\nIf you want to learn more about LeoFinance and what we're all about, look no further than LeoFinance.io. This is not only our flagship application, it is our home. The Lion's den, so to speak. This is where our community gathers 24/7/365 to talk about all things crypto, finance and DeFi. If you're coming to this page from BSC or any other platform, we hope you consider creating an account on LeoFinance.io and telling us your story.
