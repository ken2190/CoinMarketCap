{"data": {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "symbol": "DOT", "slug": "polkadot-new", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Polkadot (DOT)?\n\nPolkadot is an [open-source sharding multichain protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot) that facilitates the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby making a wide range of blockchains interoperable with each other. \n\nThis interoperability seeks to establish a fully decentralized and private web, controlled by its users, and simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services. \n\nThe Polkadot protocol connects public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot relay chain (explained further down). \n\nPolkadot\u2019s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: providing network governance and operations, and creating parachains (parallel chains) by bonding.\n\nPolkadot has four core components:\n\n\n\n*   Relay Chain: Polkadot\u2019s \u201cheart,\u201d helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains; \n*   Parachains: independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases;\n*   Parathread: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model; \n*   Bridges: allows parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Polkadot?\n\nPolkadot was founded by the Web3 Foundation, a Swiss Foundation founded to facilitate a fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web, as an open-source project. \n\nIts founders are Dr. Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban. \n\nWood, the Web3 Foundation\u2019s president, is the most well-known of the trio thanks to his industry influence as Ethereum co-founder, Parity Technologies founder and the creator of the smart contract coding language Solidity. \n\nHabermeier is a Thiel Fellow and accomplished blockchain and cryptography researcher and developer. Czaban is the Web3 Foundation\u2019s Technology Director. With a wealth of experience across highly specialized fintech industries, he is currently helping to develop a new generation of distributed technology. \n\n\n### What Makes Polkadot Unique?\n\nPolkadot is a sharded multichain network, meaning it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel (\u201cparachains\u201d). This parallel processing power improves scalability. \n\nCustom blockchains are quick and easy to develop through the Substrate framework and can be connected to Polkadot\u2019s network within minutes. The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants similar to apps on a smartphone. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs. \n\nThe network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system that also helps to secure it. Communities can customize their blockchain\u2019s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, collators and fishermen all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behavior. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Cosmos (ATOM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.</span>\n\nLearn more about [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.</span> \n\nLearn more about [Cardano (ADA)..](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/)\n\nVisit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) for trending blockchain news and insights. \n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot).\n\n\n#### How Many Polkadot (DOT) Tokens Are There in Circulation?\n\nPolkadot currently has an allocation of 1 billion DOT tokens, following the [network\u2019s redenomination](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/redenomination) from an initial maximum supply of 10 million in August 2020. The redenomination was undertaken purely to avoid the use of small decimals and make calculation easier. While all balances were increased by a factor of one hundred, this did not impact the distribution of DOT or holders\u2019 proportional share. \n\n\n### How Is the Polkadot Network Secured?\n\nPolkadot\u2019s mass interoperability through a set of common validators helps to secure its multiple blockchains and allows them to scale their transactions by spreading their data across many parachains.  \n\nThe network uses the NPoS (nominated proof-of-stake) mechanism to select validators and nominators and maximize chain security. \n\nThis unique validity scheme enables chains to interact with each other securely under the same rules, yet remain independently governed. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Polkadot (DOT)?\n\nThe top exchanges for Polkadot (DOT) trading are currently [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [HBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hbtc/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Binance.KR](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-kr/). You can find others listed on our [crypto exchanges page](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/).\n\nYou can now also buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum directly by credit card in the fiat currency of your choice.
