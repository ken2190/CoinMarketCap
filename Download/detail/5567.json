{"data": {"id": 5567, "name": "Celo", "symbol": "CELO", "slug": "celo", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Celo (CELO)?\n\nCelo is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) ecosystem focused on increasing [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) adoption among smartphone users.\n\nBy using phone numbers as public keys, Celo hopes to introduce the world\u2019s billions of smartphone owners, including those without banking access, to transacting in cryptocurrency.\n\nThe network also allows for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) as part of decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)). Its mainnet was launched in April 2020.\n\nThe platform has two native tokens. CELO is a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) token used for transaction fees, governance participation and related activities. In future, the platform aims to host various stablecoins, with one, the Celo Dollar (CUSD), already in use.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Celo?\n\nCelo was originally founded by a team comprised of people from MIT, Stanford, Google, Square, Circle, Visa, GoDaddy, World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Cambridge University, U.S. Department of Justice, Bank Of America, Capital One, Twitter, Give Directly, and the Gates Foundation\n\nSeparate entities are aimed at Celo\u2019s promotion and preservation. The dedicated Celo Foundation is a non-profit which launched along with the mainnet, while the Celo Alliance for Prosperity is what the company describes as an \u201cecosystem of mission-aligned organizations.\u201d\n\n\n#### What Makes Celo Unique?\n\nCelo\u2019s main unique selling point lies in its focus on smartphone users. The company argues that the number of smartphone owners is increasing exponentially, but the number of people using cryptocurrency is rising at a much slower pace.\n\nCryptocurrency is further highly suited to regions in which a large section of the population does not have access to the banking sector, but still has a smartphone.\n\nBridging the gap between the two technologies is what Celo aims to do, along with harnessing the benefits of DeFi by supporting the creation of DApps and smart contracts.\n\nOptimized for mobile, the Celo blockchain automatically calculates transaction fees, and also allows users to pay the [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) which power transactions in any currency.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about Facebook Libra [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/facebook-libra/).\n\nCrypto newbie?

As a stablecoin, CUSD is envisioned as a convenient payment method for Celo users who will not have to worry about their holdings fluctuating in value.\n\n\n### How Is the Celo Network Secured?\n\nCelo uses proof-of-stake to maintain security, and has a complex election process to determine validators of its blockchain.\n\nHolders of CELO are able to use their holdings as a means of participating in elections by voting for groups of validators.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Celo (CELO)?\n\nCELO is a freely tradable cryptocurrency on the [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token standard, available at various major exchanges. These include [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) and [Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/), with cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat pairs in use.\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?
