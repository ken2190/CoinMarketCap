{"data": {"id": 10524, "name": "reBaked", "symbol": "BAKED", "slug": "rebaked", "category": "token", "description": "ReBaked's value-driven system of collaboration and governance allows anyone, anywhere, to effectively cooperate and build fast-moving 3.0 infrastructure & products.\r\n\r\nWhat is reBaked?\r\n\r\nRebaked is the future of work. Collaboration beats the competition. An incentive aligned meritocratic DAO that allows anyone, anywhere, to demonstrate value into real, tangible, high-impact projects. \r\n\r\nHow reBaked works?\r\n\r\nreBaked takes a unique approach to crowdsource and open innovation. Unlike pure contest plays, the reBaked system allows collaborators to negotiate a guaranteed minimum payment in exchange for convertible tokens from promising Web 3.0 Projects. \r\n\r\nOnce accepted into the project\u2019s team, collaborators can earn additional bonuses for their work: the better the submission, the bigger the bonus. The reBaked system allows Web 3.0 projects to get polished deliverables very quickly because teams of specialists complete the work. This hyper-specialization allows collaborators to earn more and focus on their best skills.\r\nThis is the way community projects can launch faster, and create stronger community bonds. The success of Yearn, SushiSwap and other Fair Launch projects strengthens this assumption.\r\nreBaked is introducing an economy where everybody wins. It is working to achieve a collaborative union of talented individuals sharing their skills and knowledge for launching projects that adhere to the principles of a shared economy and fairness.\r\n\r\nreBaked will be ensuring the continuous provision of rewards for contributors of community-owned projects built on DAO principles. With rewards for successful project implementation distributed in such a manner that encourages investors to take long positions, the reBaked platform will be acting as an ideal and fair environment for individuals with great potential and ideas seeking like-minded professionals and sponsors who believe in them.\r\n\r\nSuggested Readings to learn more about reBaked: \r\n\r\n\r\nFair Launch As a Method of Fostering Development \r\n\r\nLink: https://medium.com/rebakedinc/fair-launch-as-a-method-of-fostering-development-dcbf0521d060\r\n\r\nCommon Ownership As An Economic Model For a Decentralized Society\r\nLink: https://medium.com/rebakedinc/common-ownership-as-an-economic-model-for-a-decentralized-society-de222cbb50b0\r\n\r\nThe Paradox of Fair Launch: How Rebaked Is Positioning To Solve The Challenges of Fair Launch Distribution\r\nLink: https://medium.com/rebakedinc/the-paradox-of-fair-launches-how-rebaked-is-positioning-to-solve-the-challenges-to-the-fair-launch-7fc14c2b366b\r\n\r\nThe Ownership Economy \u2014 The Rebaked Approach\r\nLink: https://medium.com/rebakedinc/the-ownership-economy-the-rebaked-approach-b0d6567b942", "dateAdded": "2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "192", "dateLaunched": "2021-06-06T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.03, "tags": [{"slug": "genpad", "name": "Genpad", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["http://rebaked.com/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4cb0dce4849bdcad2d553e9e68644cf40e26cce"], "source_code": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4cb0dce4849bdcad2d553e9e68644cf40e26cce#readContract"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/rebakedinc"], "chat": ["https://t.me/rebaked", "Telegram Announcements: https://t.me/rebakedann"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/rebakedinc"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.92977068571834, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10039856, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.55954688}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.32092704825381, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.27214295, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.11024999}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04594882968113, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.93324584, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.08688784}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35335416203082, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.01006705, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.31192844}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08804909629602, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32224677, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.60389594}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.357622264819, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.41626115, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.08194781}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.83378431858991, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.58354766, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.02039539}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12913193249675, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.62568219, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.61310133}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04965334281321, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.23301954, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.7174234}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:52:44.461Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
