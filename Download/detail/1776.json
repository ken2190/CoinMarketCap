{"data": {"id": 1776, "name": "MCO", "symbol": "MCO", "slug": "crypto-com", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is MCO (MCO)?\n\nThe Crypto.com project was founded in 2016 with the intention of helping everyone control their money, data and identity. It currently has over 1 million people on its platform and provides an alternative to traditional financial services. The idea of having cryptocurrency in every wallet is increasing as a result, and it is being built on solid security, privacy and most importantly, compliance, as it is the first cryptocurrency company to have CCSS Level 3, ISO 27001:2013 and PCI:DSS 3.2.1, Level 1 compliance. Its headquarters are in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Monaco (MCO) cryptocurrency is a payment platform that rebranded itself as Crypto.com back in 2018. It offers blockchain-based debit cards and a mobile wallet application. It is essentially a token for blockchain-based payment applications and trades under the symbol MCO. \n\n\n### Who Are The Founders of MCO?\n\nThe founders of MCO are Kris Marszalek, Rafael Melo and Gary Or.\n\nThe story behind MCO is quite interesting due to the fact that the founders simply wanted to help people bring back control over their money, data and identity.\n\nKris Marszalek is the CEO and co-founder of Crypto.com, after moving on from Ensogo and iBuy Group Limited. He also co-founded BEECRAZY, an e-commerce business in Hong Kong.\n\nRafelo Melo is the CFO and co-founder of Crypto.com, which he joined after moving on from Ensogo as a CFO, and from Embraer SA as the regional finance director of Asia Pacific.\n\nGary Or is the CTO and co-founder of crypto.com, as well as the founder of Particle B and the co-founder of Foris Limited, a universal money app in Asia.\n\n\n### What Makes MCO Unique?\n\nIn November of 2018, Crypto.com launched with a new token, the Crypto.com Chain, that was trading as CRO. By the middle of 2019, they launched their debit and credit cards within Asia and the U.S. \n\nThe range of products included an MCO Visa Card, a Mobile Wallet App, the MCO Token itself, and the MCO Crypto Invest Services.\n\nThe MCO Visa prepaid card helped the customers buy and spend cryptocurrency easily, while the MCO wallet and cash app allowed them to manage and buy cryptocurrencies on the smartphones themselves in a streamlined and efficient way. The cards also offered free ATM withdrawals, tap-and-pay features, no annual fees or minimum balance requirements, up to 5% back on all local or overseas spending and free shipping.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Bytom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bytom/)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Learn more about [ZKSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zkswap/).</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Discover more about Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic).</span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Learn more about crypto at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).</span>\n\n\n### How Many MCO (MCO) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe CRO Token enables cross-asset intermediary currency settlement for the native Crypto.com Chain. \n\nIn Feb. 19, 2019, the MCO tokens had the market cap of more than $47 million. The peak was achieved in January of 2018 when it reached a value of $243 million.\n\n30% of the tokens were sold as part of the ICO crowd sale, and 25% was kept by the founders, with 10% retained by the company and 5% given to advisors. The last 30% was held as reserve tokens.\n\n\n### How Is the MCO Network Secured?\n\nWhen it comes to the MCO Network security, Crypto.com secured a US$100M direct insurance policy through Arch Underwriting at Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 2012.\n\nAll funds held in the hot wallets are corporate funds and leverage hardware security modules and multi-signature key-generation technologies. These are used to ensure withdrawal requests.\n\nThe fiat currency is kept at custodian bank accounts that are secured and fully regulated. \n\nCrypto.com also uses AWS, or Amazon Web Services, and as such has network and web application firewall capabilities, controller encryption in transit through the Transport Layer Security, automatic encryption of all of the traffic and business continuity. \n\nIt is important to note that Crypto.com also has designed compliance and risk management officers who implement compliance policies and procedures while also performing internal reviews to ensure that everything is in full compliance with all of the regulatory requirements. \n\n\n## Where Can You Buy MCO (MCO)? \n\nThe exchanges where you can buy, trade or sell MCO are currently:\n\n[Huobi
