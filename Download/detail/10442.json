{"data": {"id": 10442, "name": "BitClout", "symbol": "CLOUT", "slug": "bitclout", "category": "token", "description": "BitClout is a new type of social network that mixes speculation and social media, and it\u2019s built from the ground up as its own custom blockchain. Its architecture is similar to Bitcoin, only it can support complex social network data like posts, profiles, follows, speculation features, and much more at significantly higher throughput and scale. Like Bitcoin, BitClout is a fully open-source project and there is no company behind it-- it\u2019s just coins and code.\n\nWhat is BitClout?\nA new kind of social network. If you've used BitClout, you know it's like Twitter but with a new kind of monetization tool for creators called \"creator coins.\" With BitClout, every creator gets a coin that anyone on the platform can buy and sell, which unlocks many innovative ways for creators to monetize, and allows them to create deeper relationships with their followers. Creator coins are only the beginning, though, and you can learn more about the product side of BitClout here.\n\nA new kind of blockchain. We decided to build BitClout from the ground up as its own custom blockchain. It has an architecture similar to Bitcoin, but re-imagined to support a social network. BitClout is not a company, it doesn't have a board, and there is no CEO-- it is just code that runs on nodes across the internet just like Bitcoin. Every profile, post, follow, etc... is stored on a public blockchain that everyone in the world has access to, making it a totally open platform that has the potential to solve the problems that social media has today.\n\nWhat is the long term vision of BitClout?\nThe BitClout blockchain is aimed to bring innovation and competition back to the internet. The internet started as a fundamentally decentralized thing, but we\u2019re at a point in history where things have concentrated and where innovating is harder than it used to be. After much thought over the past several years, we are convinced that the pendulum will swing back toward decentralization, perhaps permanently, and we all have an opportunity to be a part of that. A new generation of applications that the entire world can build collaboratively, unlocking the full potential of human ingenuity.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:51:05.000Z", "watchCount": "1176", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://bitclout.com/"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.bitclout.com/the-vision"], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://github.com/bitclout"], "message_board": [], "chat": [], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/Bitclout_"]}, "volume": 411494.63406205, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -8.7999, "statistics": {"price": 108.6774315859337, "priceChangePercentage1h": -0.18973399, "priceChangePercentage24h": 2.56878332, "priceChangePercentage7d": 8.70060232, "priceChangePercentage30d": -9.39381908, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 1174639149.88, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 10808492.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 2995, "low24h": 104.42844598, "high24h": 114.84972148, "low7d": 99.74985148, "high7d": 116.82095604, "low30d": 83.57449108, "high30d": 128.92883076, "low90d": 0.0, "high90d": 198.84331972, "low52w": 0.0, "high52w": 198.84331972, "lowAllTime": 0.0, "highAllTime": 198.84331972, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 0, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -45.35, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-16T17:46:04.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-19T20:57:04.000Z", "lowYesterday": 103.72790578, "highYesterday": 117.15929561, "openYesterday": 103.95224055, "closeYesterday": 106.24289326, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 2.2, "volumeYesterday": 558831.89, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.93913845067335, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10541915, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.63438799}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33773955512395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.23981776, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.41715042}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04592046794645, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.23029735, "priceChangePercentage7d": 17.9758293}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08803051270921, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32754572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.77415107}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.86320486217138, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.14307618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6744906}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884102685655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.39973257, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44788409}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 453, "name": "AscendEX (Bitmax)", "slug": "ascendex"}, {"id": 1254, "name": "Blockchain.com", "slug": "blockchain-com-exchange"}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:52:11.791Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
