The supply is constantly rising as new tokens are getting minted and distributed as rewards. It launched in April 2021. \r\n\r\nThe Lab Finance (LABO) offers at launch 11 pools and 11 farms that generate yield returns paid with LABO. The options to stake in the platform include popular tokens and LP tokens. The APY earned staking LP tokens is higher than staking single asset token as liquidity providers are facing the risk of [impermanent loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/). Once NFT model goes live, the farming protocol will share the deposit and minting fees among the holders.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the risk of a rug pull, The Lab Finance has removed migrator code from the Masterchef contract and there is a 24-hours timelock contract applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who Are The Founders of The Lab Finance?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of April 2021, the Founders of the project remain anonymous.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What Makes The Lab Finance Unique?\r\n\r\nThe Lab Finance focuses on pushing decentralization by the implementation of an NFT model where the owners are generating yield from the deposit fee and minting reward fees. The platform also will incorporate a voting mechanism to fine-tune several variables of the farming mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lab Finance focuses on sharing the revenues accrued by the farming protocol through a NFT model where 50 holders will be accumulating the 3% of the deposit fees and 60% of the developer minting fees. This unique mechanism will increase the decentralization of the platform, giving the opportunity to more holders to receive additional rewards. \r\n\r\nThere are as well burning mechanisms to counter the inflation of the minting such as burning a 20% of the developer minting fee or burn the revenues generated by the NFT sales or burning coming from the deposit fees generated when users stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related Pages:\r\n\r\nRead more about [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/).\r\n\r\nRead more about [Goosedefi](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/goose-finance/).\r\n\r\nNew to cryptocurrency?

They have removed the migrator backdoor found in PancakeSwap and SushiSwap ([SUSHI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/)).\r\n\r\nThe team behind it is prevented from mitigating assets by the code, ensuring the safety of the funds. Timelock was also added to the contract at launch.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where Can You Buy The Lab Finance (LABO)?\r\n\r\nThe Lab Finance (LABO) can be traded on the following exchanges:\r\n\r\n*
