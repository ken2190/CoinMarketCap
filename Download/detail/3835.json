{"data": {"id": 3835, "name": "Orbs", "symbol": "ORBS", "slug": "orbs", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Orbs (ORBS)?\n\n[Orbs](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orbs/) is a public[ blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) infrastructure that combines scalability, low fees, performance, security, and ease of use.\n\nThe platform is designed for mass-use applications and supports a complete blockchain stack. The Orbs platform is a decentralized, open and transparent network that offers practical blockchain solutions for enterprises and other large-scale consumer applications.\n\nThe Orbs protocol uses the ORBS token, which calculates commissions for executed applications and provides an incentive system that is used to select validators, thereby ensuring the integrity of the network. The ORBS token serves as the only means of payment on the Orbs platform.\n\nOrbs was established in 2017 and was developed by experienced engineers, businessmen and scientists who have managed to create an infrastructure that uses blockchain virtualization and randomized proof-of-stake (RPoS) to ensure blockchain[ scalability](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain-trilemma).\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Orbs?\n\nThere are four people behind Orbs: Daniel Peled, Tal Kol, Netta Korin and Uriel Peled.\n\nDaniel Peled is president of Orbs. He is also the co-founder and CEO of an Israeli fintech startup called PayKey. Peled is a veteran of the Israeli[ Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) community and holds an LLM and Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Economics.\n\nTal Kol holds a Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Computer Engineering from the Technion, a university in Haifa, Israel. He\u2019s an expert in blockchain applications and was formerly the head of engineering at Kin by Kik Interactive. Prior to Orbs, he co-founded Appixia, a mobile app startup that was acquired by Wix.com.\n\nNetta Korin began her career on Wall Street as an investment banker and later retrained as a hedge fund manager. Korin has an impressive philanthropic background. Moreover, prior to her success at Orbs, she served as senior advisor to Deputy Minister for Diplomacy Dr. Michael Oren in the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\n\nUriel Peled is a consultant on a number of blockchain projects, which has earned him a reputation as one of the most influential and respected tech personalities in Israel. He has a degree in electrical engineering from the Technion. Before joining the Orbs team, Peled co-founded Visualead, an AR/VR startup that was later acquired by Alibaba.\n\n\n## What Makes Orbs (ORBS) Unique?\n\nOrbs is a public blockchain platform that supports[ smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and works by complementing the already existing[ Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) standards. This combination of Orbs and Ethereum allows[ DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) on the platform to take advantage of both chains at once, enjoying security, liquidity, low tariffs, scalability and access to payment infrastructure.\n\n**Key benefits include:**\n\n\n\n* The seamless transfer tokens between blockchains.\n    * \n* Developers have access to the ecosystem, its wallets, tokens and exchanges.\n    * \n* With Orbs' scalable production environment, users have access to the benefits of basic liquidity.\n\nThere are two types of roles in the Orbs platform ecosystem: delegators and guardians.\n\nDelegators are [ORBS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orbs/) token holders who assign their voting weight (their share) to the guardians, who are tasked with keeping the network safe. The guardians are thus widely represented in the ecosystem via a delegated stake and can vote for validators without following protocol.\n\nOn top of this, Orbs has developed two technologies: virtual chains and randomized proof-of-stake (RPoS). DApps that use Orbs deploy their own separate virtual chain to maximize performance, while the RPoS consensus mechanism ensures security and decentralization.\n\n\n## Related Pages:\n\nRead about[ Bancor](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bancor/) (BNT) and[ 0x](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/0x/) (ZRX). \n\nWhat are DApps?

Let's go back to basics via our[ educational portal](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-blockchain).\n\nTake a look at the CoinMarketCap[ blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n## How Many Orbs (ORBS) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nOrbs is an[ ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token that operates on the Ethereum platform. Tokens are the main means of payment for all services on the Orbs platform. Via the token, users can pay for services from infrastructure operators  and the token is also used to select validators and to manage the protocol in general.\n\nThe network\u2019s total supply is 10 billion[ ORBS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orbs/) tokens. This supply is fixed and is generated using a process called priming. The distribution of tokens is as follows: 55% for long-term reserves, 20% for private sales, 20% for the team and founding partners, 5% for advisors.\n\n\n## How Is the Orbs Network Secured?\n\nThe proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) ecosystem is the basis for the Orbs network and ensures its security and smooth operations, thereby optimizing the platform for DApps.\n\nFor its part, randomized proof-of-stake (RPoS), is both fast and secure. For each round of consensus, a selection is made from a set of validators, executed by small, random committees. This randomization and set of validators serve to establish security and decentralization and, with the committees\u2019 help, consensus is achieved. This Orbs model is called Helix. It\u2019s a[ Byzantine fault-tolerant](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) and scalable algorithm, in which guardians and delegators use a stake to select validators.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Orbs (ORBS)?\n\nIn the rapidly evolving[ DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) ecosystem, the Orbs blockchain platform has managed to implement a set of integrations with decentralized exchanges (DEXs). As of July 2021,[ ORBS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orbs/)' share of the total cryptocurrency market is 0.01%, and the list of exchanges where ORBS can be traded includes[ Bithumb](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb/),[ KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/),[ Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/),[ OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/),[ Indodax](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/indodax/),[ ProBit Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/probit-exchange/),[ Upbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upbit/),[ Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/),[ Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/),[ Coinone](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinone/),[ Huobi Korea](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-korea/),[ LiteBit.eu](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/litebit/),[ Bitsonic](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitsonic/),[ KyberDMM (Kyber Dynamic Market Make Protocol)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kyberdmm/),[ BHEX (BlueHelix Exchange)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bhex-bluehelix/), and[ Bitbns](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitbns/).\n\nCryptocurrency newbie?
