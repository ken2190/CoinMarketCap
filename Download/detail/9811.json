{"data": {"id": 9811, "name": "Catjam", "symbol": "CATJAM", "slug": "catjam", "category": "token", "description": "In essence, Catjam is a charity token that aims to use the power of crypto and the blockchain to help people make a change in the world. The project was developed to use the influence of memes to bring about this change. We believe the future of finance, economy and politics is decentralization and true democracy.\r\n\r\nCatjam is a deflationary, yield generating token on the Binance Smart Chain. Every time a transaction takes place, 2% of that transaction is distributed to all the holders and sent to the \u201cblack hole\u201d wallet, essentially removing some of it from the total supply. Another 2% of the transaction is sent and locked into the liquidity pool. This increases the scarcity of every token in circulation. What this means is that every time Catjam tokens are used, the value of the remaining tokens in circulation is increased by simultaneously decreasing the supply, while also distributing Catjam to everyone using the token.\r\n\r\nA Charity Wallet containing 10% of the supply, which is locked with vesting enabled, is used in our charity campaigns, marketing and expenses. Because of the 2% tax on every transaction, every time we donate to a cause, you will receive tokens in your wallet as a reward for being part of the community. The community will decide the course of our altruistic campaigns by voting in the polls. In the future, your vote will be minted into the blockchain and registered in the Catjam token contract. One of our missions is to help cats and provide them a free and fulfilling life. By holding or trading Catjam Tokens, you are part of this mission and will change the world of cats, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not\u2026", "dateAdded": "2021-05-14T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "71", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-09T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 1.93524e-06, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://catjamtoken.io/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xA8C5CeBB7a098f1eE30014984201036A92893CA7"], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://catjam.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/catjamtoken", "https://discord.com/invite/2QYNyuAkHf"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/CatJAMToken"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/catjamtoken"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xA8C5CeBB7a098f1eE30014984201036A92893CA7", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xA8C5CeBB7a098f1eE30014984201036A92893CA7", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.14770510434796, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.12304848, "priceChangePercentage7d": 53.83680601}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.08948521717125, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.05496242, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50256086}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0463266287478, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13415688, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.4756861}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34158907038751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.96859664, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.45374901}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08827561295395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.52347736, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.42732901}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33218429865312, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.34412525, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.45266776}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.65780294191658, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.60956613, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.69376176}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12744789978998, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.21786754, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.8643341}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04507747416068, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.01797293, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.73429399}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:37:30.285Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "10", "credit_count": 0}}
