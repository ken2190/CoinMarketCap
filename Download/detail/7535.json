{"data": {"id": 7535, "name": "Keep3rV1", "symbol": "KP3R", "slug": "keep3rv1", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Keep3rV1 (KP3R)?\n\nKeep3rV1 is a decentralized platform designed to facilitate the coordination between projects that need to source outside development operations and those who can provide those required services. Essentially, the project serves as a job board that facilitates the interaction between job posters, such as [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) protocols, and job executors, known as Keepers. The tasks performed by Keepers range from submitting and calling transactions on-chain to completing complex operations off-chain. Keep3rV1 uses an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, KP3R, for governance and to provide rewards to Keepers.\n\nThe project was first [announced](https://andrecronje.medium.com/keep3r-network-ba5af26c1f24) on Oct. 22, 2020. It [launched](https://andrecronje.medium.com/keep3r-network-v1-beta-20ab98c9e91a) on the Ethereum mainnet in beta mode on Oct. 28, 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Keep3rV1?\n\nKeep3rV1 was founded by Andre Cronje, a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) engineer and application developer who recently rose to prominence following the launch of DeFi project [yearn.finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/) and the [explosive growth](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/02/inside-ethereums-testnet-headwinds-growth-in-tokenized-bitcoin-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock-2/) of its governance token, YFI, which saw a 1,300-times increase in value during its first two months of existence in 2020.\n\nCronje [previously served](https://medium.com/@fusionprotocol/fusion-gaining-steam-leading-blockchain-code-reviewer-author-of-cryptobriefing-andre-cronje-c28f4521fa64) as head of innovation and technology at the Fusion Foundation, the organization behind the Fusion protocol, where he led initiatives related to [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps), technology partnerships and implementations. He also worked as chief code reviewer and a contributor at Crypto Briefing, head of technology at fintech firm Freedom, and head of technology at Shoprite Group, in addition to serving in blockchain technology development roles for BitDiem, Cryptocurve and Lemniscap.\n\nDespite the incredible growth of yearn.finance and YFI, Cronje [has stated](https://andrecronje.medium.com/unpacking-my-involvement-in-defi-cdb6479e337d) that his goal in launching new platforms is to empower developers, not speculators, by providing them with easy-to-use products and design templates.\n\n\n### What Makes Keep3rV1 Unique?\n\nKeep3rV1 seeks to reduce the upkeep faced by blockchain-based projects that utilize large numbers of [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to power increasingly complex systems. These projects often require external actors to complete tasks, and Keep3rV1 is designed to be a decentralized ecosystem for projects and developers to more efficiently work together. \n \nThe network relies on Keepers, who provide smart contracts, bots or scripts that are able to execute transactions or trigger events. To use the platform, a project submits a smart contract that is reviewed and approved by a bonded Keeper \u2014 one that has received and locked KP3R in the platform. Projects can set rules regarding which Keepers may take a job, such as requiring a minimum bonded stake of KP3R or a certain number of already completed jobs. Keepers are rewarded in KP3R for completing jobs, although a project may submit [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) in exchange for KP3R-equivalent credits.\n\nCronje has said that Keep3rV1 has the added benefit of allowing for the development of DApps that would otherwise not be possible, including [MetaWallet](https://andrecronje.medium.com/metawallet-a-gasless-wallet-58bf2ab88931) \u2014 a smart-contract wallet that does not require transactions or [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) \u2014 and [Unihedge](https://andrecronje.medium.com/uniquote-unihedge-and-uniswapv2oracle-f120838aabb8) \u2014 an [impermanent loss](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) mitigation system.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Origin Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/origin-protocol/), a commerce platform that seeks to connect buyers and sellers.\n\nLearn about [yearn.finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/), the DeFi project that propelled Cronje to popularity.\n\nNew to DeFi? Read an [in-depth guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on the latest blockchain innovations with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n### How Many Keep3rV1 (KP3R) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nKeep3rV1 has no predetermined token supply, and the project did not undergo an [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) or token generation event. Rather, KP3R is minted when [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) is provided to the platform via [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/). At the project's launch, Keep3rV1 had a [reported](https://andrecronje.medium.com/keep3r-network-economics-c7a7088753ef) $5.5 million worth of liquidity. Within the first day, it had already [reached](https://andrecronje.medium.com/keep3r-network-v1-october-update-b533f0264723) $9.8 million, with $384,197 in fees generated.\n\nThe project's treasury is maintained by bonded Keepers, who are responsible for governance. Each non-KP3R transaction on the platform is charged a 0.3% fee, which is distributed to the treasury. Keepers who complete jobs are rewarded with KP3R, which can then be staked in order to participate in governance or receive dividends, should the platform's governance decide to generate and distribute them.\n\n\n### How Is the Keep3rV1 Network Secured?\n\nKeep3rV1 is an Ethereum-based platform that utilizes KP3R, an ERC-20 governance token. This means that it relies on the Ethereum blockchain to validate any on-chain KP3R transactions. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nWithin the Keep3rV1 platform itself, bonded Keepers are [responsible for](https://docs.keep3r.network/governance) managing and approving jobs and for managing Keepers \u2014 including settling disputes and blacklisting bad actors, if necessary.\n\nThe project's smart contracts were [audited](https://andrecronje.medium.com/keep3r-network-update-audit-967a9ecbab4c) at the end of October 2020 by PeckShield, a blockchain security company, before it went live. The audit [found](https://github.com/keep3r-network/keep3r.network/blob/master/audits/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Keep3r-v1.0.pdf) that Keep3rV1 was \"well-designed and engineered\" and uncovered no critical security flaws, but it did identify some potential medium- to high-severity risks, which Croje stated have been logged and updated.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Keep3rV1 (KP3R)?\n\nKP3R is primarily exchanged on [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), where it can be traded against [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) (WETH) and [USD Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) (USDC). It is also available for purchase on [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/), [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), where it can be traded on spot markets against [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [Binance Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) (BNB) and [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT), respectively.\n\nAre you interested in buying KP3R or other [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC)?
