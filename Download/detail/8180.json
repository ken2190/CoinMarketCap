It is the basis of an incentive-driven rewards program with \u201cpoints\u201d that are rewarded in the form of a decentralized, blockchain-based digital asset known as Action (\u201cACTN\u201d). Action may be redeemed for member-only discounts on a growing list of products and services offered through our business network.\n\n**How it works for Vendors?**\n\nVendors market and sell their products and services through the Action Coin Platform in exchange for Action Coin (\u201cAction\u201d or \u201cACTN\u201d). It is up to the vendor to determine how much Action they are prepared to accept for their products or services (the suggested rate of exchange for deals on the Action Coin Platform is 1.00 ACTN for every $1.00 USD in savings. They may choose to accept Action Coin for partial payment or full payment, but their choice and their terms of business must be clearly stated and explained within the description of their offer.\n\n**How it works for Customers?**\n\nAction Coin (\u201cAction\u201d or \u201cACTN\u201d) is earned by joining our website, referring friends and family to our platform and participating in community activities (such as mining and staking). Collectors may use their Action Coin to obtain deals and discounts (1.00 ACTN = $1.00 USD in SAVINGS) on a growing list of products and services offered by Vendors from more than 30 countries. Collectors may also trade their Action Coin (ACTN) for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and more than 100 other crypto-assets. The real world price and liquidity of ACTN is determined by people everywhere, through third-party wallets and exchanges.\n\n**2019-2022 Major Goals**\n\nSignificant Marketplace Improvements (Ver 3.0)\nExpanded Marketplace Coverage (to more than 100 countries)\n- 100 to 200 Brand Ambassadors Promoting Action Coin\n- 25,000 to 50,000 Vendors Accepting Action Coin\nMobile Application Development (Android)\nIncreased Action Coin (ACTN) Liquidity\nIncreased Brand Awareness Through Major Television Networks\nRapid User Acquisition & Adoption\n\n**Brand Ambassador Network**\n\nAction Coin has more than 80 enthusiastic brand ambassadors worldwide\nBrand Ambassadors actively promote the Action Coin platform in exchange for Action Coin bounties\nBrand ambassadors provide our users with a local point of contact in more than 30 countries\n\n**Technical Specification**\n\nBlock rewards over the next 10 years: 200,000,000 ACTN\n\n\u2022 Year 1: 52,560,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 100 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 2: 52,560,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 100 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 3: 26,280,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 50 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 4: 26,280,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 50 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 5: 13,140,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 25 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 6: 13,140,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 25 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 7: 6,570,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 12.5 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 8: 6,570,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 12.5 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 9: 1,450,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 6.25 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n\u2022 Year 10: 1,450,000 ACTN ~ Block Reward: 6.25 ACTN (525,600 blocks)\n\n", "dateAdded": "2021-01-05T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "119", "dateLaunched": "2017-07-04T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://actioncoin.com"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://exp.actioncoin.com"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/actioncoininc/action/blob/master/README.md"], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/officialactioncoin\r\nhttps://t.me/ActionCoinNews"], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2156370.0 (outdated)"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/actioncoin"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/actioncoin"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.19681560352052, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.42357691, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.52018296}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.18018501079094, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.80505683, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.70179496}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04638084879111, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.09409206, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.10624481}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.33537395701624, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.23811977, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.46837399}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08918126241485, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.42479367, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.18417278}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35785603826278, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.68322056, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.36729502}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.59016290530985, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.83748159, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.29928939}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12843917769279, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.84516333, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.40638069}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04927899304262, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.69314563, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.10947684}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:25:52.180Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
