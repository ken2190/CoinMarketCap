Tokocrypto\u2019s latest project, TKO, is the first Indonesian cryptocurrency to offer a unique hybrid token model.\n\nThe token serves several purposes on the Tokocrypto [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform and allows users to participate in crypto exchanges, deposit and savings programs, cross-platform DeFi applications, and NFT marketplaces. Toko Token was officially launched in April 2021 and has since attracted the attention of both private and enterprise users. The Tokocrypto platform was created in tandem with [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), which serves as a significant backing for the project and its future development. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Toko Token?\n\n[Pang Xue Kai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pang-xue-kai/) is the founder and CEO of Tokocrypto. He graduated with a degree in engineering from the National University of Singapore and immediately launched into a tech career. His professional journey started as a product design engineer for TechnipFMC in 2015. He spent two years with the company and, in 2017, started polishing the idea for Tokocrypto. The company was officially launched in January 2018. Kai is also a governing council member of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce. \n\n[Teguh Kurniawan Harmanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teguhkurniawanharmanda/) is the chief operating officer of Tokocrytpo. He graduated with a master\u2019s course in economics of development from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) in 2016. His professional career started as a product development and market feedback representative for Blaast in 2012. In 2016, he became the chief financial officer for AMAZARA, and in 2018 he joined Tokocrypto as the lead of business development. Since then, he climbed up the ranks and became the company\u2019s COO.\n\n[Chung Ying Lai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chung-ying-lai/) is the chief strategy officer at Tokocypto. He graduated with honors in engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2015.

Of these, 20% went towards the Tokocypto Foundation and will undergo semi-annual distribution over five years.\n\nAnother 17% were dedicated to marketing and advertising of the Toko Token and the Tokocrypto platform. 15% of the total token supply was distributed among founding team members as a reward for participating in the project. Partnerships and strategic ecosystem collaborations received another 17% of the supply. Tokocrypto has set aside 3% of all tokens as mining rewards and an additional 2% as rewards for project advisors. The company distributed 10% of the supply through community airdrops and dedicated 1% of tokens for private sales. \n\n\n### How Is the Toko Token Network Secured?\n\nToko Token is a Binance Smart Chain token or a BEP20 coin. BEP20 is a developer-friendly token standard that allows anyone to deploy fungible digital currencies or tokens on [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain). What's more, leading digital assets on other chains can be ported onto the blockchain in the form of pegged BEP20 tokens.\n\nThe Binance Smart Chain utilizes both delegated proof-of-stake ([dPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) and proof-of-authority ([PoA](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa)) consensus mechanisms to secure transaction validation on the chain. In this model, there are elected validators who take turns in confirming transactions on the network and are tasked to produce the blocks in a PoA manner, which puts their stake and reputation in the community into consideration. To become a validator, a user has to stake [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/).\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Toko Token (TKO)?\n\nAs a Binance Smart Chain token, the best option to purchase TKO is through the Binance crypto exchange. It has the largest TKO/USDT trading volume as of April 2021.\n\nAnother option to purchase TKO tokens is Gate.io.\n\n[Find more information](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about buying
