{"data": {"id": 8098, "name": "The Blocknet", "symbol": "ABLOCK", "slug": "the-blocknet", "category": "coin", "description": "# What is the Blocknet?\r\nJust as the internet connects computers, the Blocknet connects users on any blockchain, enabling decentralized access to effectively every blockchain in existence.\r\n\r\nWhether it\u2019s through powering a [decentralized Infura](https://blocknet.co/hydra), [decentralized APIs](https://docs.blocknet.co/protocol/xrouter/introduction/), or [the most decentralized exchange](https://blockdx.com/), the Blocknet provides developers with the tools to create the applications of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What is the difference between the Blocknet and other blockchain interoperability projects?\r\nThe Blocknet is the only inter-blockchain (\u201cinterchain\u201d) project that is not partisan with regard to the blockchains it integrates. While other projects \u201cbridge\u201d two chains via some middle chain, the Blocknet does not privilege its own chain above the chains it connects. Instead, it supports the construction of proofs of arbitrary strength about state on any chain. This way, users are not required to use any chains that they do not wish to, and the security of their interaction is not dependent upon some middle chain\u2019s security. In a word, the Blocknet decentralizes the interchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What is aBLOCK?\r\naBLOCK, an ERC20 token, is wrapped [BLOCK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/blocknet/), the native coin of the Blocknet. The BLOCK:aBLOCK bridge is provided by AnySwap.\r\n\r\naBLOCK functions as a means of payment for [Hydra](https://blocknet.co/hydra), a drop-in decentralized replacement for Infura.\r\n\r\nBLOCK, its underlying coin, tokenises [service node](https://docs.blocknet.co/service-nodes/introduction/) ownership. Services nodes are  the Blocknet\u2019s interchain overlay network, hosting multiple blockchains and responding to requests for chain data.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How many coins are in circulation?\r\nThe Blocknet\u2019s mainnet went live in November 2014 after an initial token offering, with 3,876,915.43 coins sold. As of 2020, the coin supply is approximately 7.3m coins. Coin issuance is via block rewards. Block rewards are 1 BLOCK per block, awarded to the winning staker of that block. Block time targets 1 block/minute. This results in a linear increase in coin supply, but decreasing issuance rate relative to the coin supply. For further details see [docs.blocknet.co](https://docs.blocknet.co/blockchain/introduction/#block-inflation).\r\n\r\n\r\n# How is the project governed?\r\nThe Blocknet is governed by its own network of [service nodes](https://docs.blocknet.co/service-nodes/introduction/), who vote monthly to fund proposals submitted to the network. Funding for successful proposals is via [superblock](https://docs.blocknet.co/governance/introduction/), in which coins are minted at proposals\u2019 addresses. This secures funding for the project indefinitely.", "dateAdded": "2020-12-23T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "28", "launchPrice": 0.1, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://blocknet.co", "https://blockdx.com"], "technical_doc": ["https://blocknet.co/whitepaper/Blocknet_Whitepaper.pdf"], "explorer": ["https://chainz.cryptoid.info/block/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/BlocknetDX"], "message_board": ["https://theblocknetchannel.medium.com/", "https://blocknet.co/blog/"], "chat": ["https://discord.gg/2e6s7H8", "t.me/blocknet"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/theblocknet"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/The_Blocknet"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0xe692c8d72bd4ac7764090d54842a305546dd1de5", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0xe692c8d72bd4ac7764090d54842a305546dd1de5", "contractDecimals": 8, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.34647458231691, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.2100706, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.83490608}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.17504585604558, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.43026057, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.7337848}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04635418939475, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.77578946, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.04909387}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35806844031862, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.39438934, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.6856766}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08913289218428, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.94475399, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.1858528}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35775119797612, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.65464908, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.29590174}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.58908905296996, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.30883116, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.29022533}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12851358840073, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.73564861, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.48413819}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.0508112068182, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.59825653, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.24542066}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:25:17.067Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "10", "credit_count": 0}}
