{"data": {"id": 1321, "name": "Ethereum Classic", "symbol": "ETC", "slug": "ethereum-classic", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Ethereum Classic (ETC)?\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is a hard fork of [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) that launched in July 2016. Its main function is as a [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) network, with the ability to host and support decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). Its native token is ETC.\n\nSince its launch, Ethereum Classic has sought to differentiate itself from Ethereum, with the two networks\u2019 technical roadmap diverging further and further from each other with time.\n\nEthereum Classic first set out to preserve the integrity of the existing Ethereum blockchain after a major hacking event led to the theft of 3.6 million ETH.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Ethereum Classic?\n\nEthereum Classic is in fact the legacy chain of Ethereum, and its true creators are therefore the original Ethereum developers \u2014 Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood.\n\nA [contentious hard fork on Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic) occurred in July 2016, when participants disagreed over whether to revert the blockchain to cancel out the effects of a major hack. This impacted The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) which had raised approximately $150 million in an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) several months earlier.\n\nEthereum Classic came into being as the network which did not revert the chain. Developers state that there is no \u201cofficial\u201d team attached to the project, and that its \u201cglobal development community is a permissionless 'do-ocracy,' where anyone can participate.\u201d \n\n\n#### What Makes Ethereum Classic Unique?\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s main aim is to preserve the Ethereum blockchain as it originally was, without artificially countering the DAO hack.\n\nIts appeal was first to those who disagreed with Ethereum\u2019s response, but the legacy network has since gained a wider fan base, which include major investors such as Barry Silbert, CEO of investment firm Grayscale. \n\nAs a voluntary organization, the developers of ETC do not aim to turn the network into a for-profit entity. Users pay transaction fees as with Ethereum, and miners collect them based on work done as per the [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) mining algorithm.\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Ethereum Classic has no plans to convert to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mining algorithm, while multiple developers continue to work on future improvements such as scaling solutions. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about Ethereum [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum).\n\nRead more about Bitcoin Cash [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash).\n\nNew to cryptocurrency? Find all the information you need with [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics), CoinMarketCap\u2019s dedicated education resource. \n\n\n#### How Many Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\nETC began in a very similar technical state to ETH, with the exception of how the DAO hack transactions were handled.\n\nSince launch, however, changes in [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) have occurred, with participants voting to cap the supply of ETC in December 2017. The maximum supply is thus 210,700,000 ETC, roughly ten times that of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC), while ETH has no cap.\n\nETC uses a PoW mining algorithm, which functions like [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) \u2014 miners are rewarded with new coins for validating the blockchain in competition with each other. The ETC block reward decreases with time, with the next drop due at block 15,000,000, roughly in April 2022 \u2014 from 3.2 ETC to 2.56 ETC per block.\n\n\n### How Is the Ethereum Classic Network Secured?\n\nThe Ethereum Classic network is secured using proof-of-work, but as a minority chain, it has suffered regular attacks itself.\n\nThese include several 51% attacks to gain control of mining hashrate and execute spurious transactions and double spend coins, the most recent of which occurred in August 2020.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Ethereum Classic (ETC)?\n\nETC is a major market cap cryptocurrency and is freely tradable on a large number of major exchanges. \n\nPairs are available against stablecoins, other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, while derivatives and institutional investment vehicles also exist. Exchanges that let you [buy Ethereum Classic](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Ethereum-Classic) include [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/).\n\nCrypto newbie?
