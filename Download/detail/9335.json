{"data": {"id": 9335, "name": "Crypto Family Token", "symbol": "FT", "slug": "crypto-family-token", "category": "token", "description": "While the world is full with cryptos of many purposes and technologies we felt that it still lacks a coin or token that can act as a native currency that can suport many transactions for cheap and provide a never ending life cycle of an anti inflationary token.\r\n\r\nSatoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, it introduced the world to the concept of decentralization and anti inflation. But while Bitcoin offered the world those features it had major issues that make it hard to rely on as an asset for simple payments such as buying a coke due to it's slow transactions and high fees, and even though Bitcoin is coded to have a limited amount of coins, it has a limited life cycle, when all Bitcoin are mined it will be very hard for new users to benefit from Bitcoin mining and it's gonna be hard for miners to keep up their mining operations off the transaction fees which will result in many miners shutting down their mining operations and eventually the end of the Bitcoin life cycle.\r\n\r\nAdvanced block chains such as the Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot and others offer a very fast and cheap payment method that can help offer cryptos fit for simple and big exchanges, however such blockchains lack the principle of anti inflation as their production of coins is never ending.\r\n\r\nFT aims to combine the above principles and features to offer an anti inflationary token with very fast and cheap transactions, aswell as a life cycle that hardly ends, giving the world a token fit for holding and exchanging aswell as a never ending life cycle of staking and wealth redistribution.\r\n\r\nFEATURES AND PRINCIPLES OF FT\r\n\r\nStaking\r\nUnlike many other tokens and coins that are genrated through minting, new FT can only be found through staking of FT, making the FT community and FT holders the only users capable of finding new FT and placing it into existence, marking FT a token of its community and its community only\r\nFT is also staked on the Crypto Family Bridge nodes to help ashieve PoSA 'Proof of Staked Authority' in between nodes and on the blockchains to help secure transactions and prevent any false transactions or attacks on the Bridge\r\n\r\nAnti Inflation\r\nFT is an anti inflationary token with a fixed total supply of 1,000,000 FT and an APR of 4% from staking rewards\r\nAt release of the FT smart contract there will be a supply of 25,000 FT with the remaining 975,000 FT waiting to be found by stakers in the next 100-1000 years\r\n\r\nLife Cycle\r\nFT follows the Life Cycle principle which takes care of placing FT back into circulation after it's use in the Crypto Family City\r\nWhen a user pays FT fees in the City, that FT is placed back into circulation rejoining the remaining FT in the line waiting to be found by the stakers\r\nThis feature makes sure that FT will have a never ending cycle of staking, minting, burning, and redistribution while keeping a total supply of only 1,000,000 FT\r\n\r\nCheap Multiple Transfers\r\nFT is built on top of the Binance Smart Chain which allows for instant cheap transactions, FT also supports double, triple, quadruple, quintuple and Decupletransfers to help ease transfers to multiple users and reduce the gas cost, in certain cases FT transactions have prooven to be the cheapest on the Binance Smart Chain, even cheaper than BNB transactions", "dateAdded":
