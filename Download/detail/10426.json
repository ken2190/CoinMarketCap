The team claims self absorbed business leaders like Elon Musk have been able to affect prices on Cryptocurrency and Stock Exchanges across the world with simple tweets and comments in the media. Growing sentiment among ordinary people worldwide: it\u2019s time to stop this trend. We\u2019ve had enough!\n\nStopelon is a community driven and the first protest token and what sets us aside from other cryptocurrency is the mission.\nThe goal of Stopelon is to acquire enough voting power at Tesla and take control of the company from Elon Musk, enabling and rewarding token holders at the same time. \n\nStopelon has already been featured in news articles around the globe.\n\nStopelon tokenomics:\n- Stopelon has a fixed supply and no new tokens can be minted (or created).\n- A total of 10% (5%+5%) of total supply are used in Developer wallet and Marketing wallet.\n- Stopelon is a deflationary BEP-20 Token with over 40% of total supply burned (automatically and manually)\n- Our 10% tax on every transaction is currently set up to redistribute 2% to holders and 8% to Pancakeswap liquidity pool.\nThis current setting is necessary to grow our LP to Market Cap ratio to support a resilient price floor in the initial few weeks.\nOnce we have achieved a solid LP to MC ratio (our target is 10%), we will redistribute 6% to holders and 4% to LP. We will enable \u201cautomatic burning\u201d by including the burn wallet in the redistribution at this point.\nIt\u2019s important to note that in order to make sure our holders are not penalized by this initial taxation while growing our LP, we decided to exclude the burn wallet (48%), the marketing wallet (5%) and the dev wallet (5%) from the reward. Thus, the 2% are split to only 40% of the total supply, making an effective ~5% reward to holders (instead of 6%).\nTarget tax will be 10% (4% to LP and 6% to holders, all wallet included).\n\nStopelon upcoming features:\n- June 2021: monthly exclusive NFT featuring promonent figures of our modern history will be distributed to all our holders to ensure that they are not only rewarded with tax distribution but also with time-limited items.\n- By Q3 2021: we will open our Stopelon Voting Trust (SVT) and allow people to deposit their Tesla shares to support the movement and then scale it into a staking platform.\n- By Q3 2021: we will offer a governance platform (SIP - Stopelon Improvement Proposal) to let $Stopelon holders decide of the future and the directions of the project by voting on different proposal. \n- By Q4 2021/Q1 2022, developing the idea of Stopelon Voting Trust further, we would like to set-up a stock-pegged staking platform to let people stake Tesla Share to earn $Stopelon. This process takes time as we are trying to figure out the legal aspects and possibilities before starting the technical development.\n\n\n## How Many STOPELON Tokens Are There in Circulation?\n\nStopelon launched on BSC mainnet on May 16th, 2021 with 1,000,000,000,000 STOPELON tokens created at genesis with 43% were initially burnt. It's reported more manual and automatic burns are going to occur and no new token will be minted anymore.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:51:07.000Z", "watchCount": "10742", "dateLaunched": "2021-05-13T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.stopelon.space/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xD83cec69ED9d8044597A793445C86a5e763b0E3D"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/StopElon_BSC"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/STOPELON_BSC"]}, "volume": 11104.805739, "volumeChangePercentage24h": -9.4475, "statistics": {"price": 1.91862792e-06, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.37295446, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.51198178, "priceChangePercentage7d": -11.16398122, "priceChangePercentage30d": -72.40023732, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 1918627.92, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 1000000000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 4114, "low24h": 1.8e-06, "high24h": 1.93e-06, "low7d": 1.8e-06, "high7d": 2.26e-06, "low30d": 1.47e-06, "high30d": 7.74e-06, "low90d": 1.47e-06, "high90d": 3.341e-05, "low52w": 1.47e-06, "high52w": 3.341e-05, "lowAllTime": 1.47e-06, "highAllTime": 3.341e-05, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 30.52, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -94.26, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-20T10:08:03.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-15T11:01:03.000Z", "lowYesterday": 1.8e-06, "highYesterday": 1.94e-06, "openYesterday": 1.91e-06, "closeYesterday": 1.84e-06, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": -3.66, "volumeYesterday": 17079.35, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xD83cec69ED9d8044597A793445C86a5e763b0E3D", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xD83cec69ED9d8044597A793445C86a5e763b0E3D", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.93913845067335, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10541915, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.63438799}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33773955512395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.23981776, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.41715042}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04592046794645, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.23029735, "priceChangePercentage7d": 17.9758293}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08803051270921, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32754572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.77415107}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.86320486217138, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.14307618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6744906}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884102685655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.39973257, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44788409}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:52:04.702Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
