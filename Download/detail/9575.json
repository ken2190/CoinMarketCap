Now i bring you this #Hamtaro to launch on Binance Smart Chain with Tiny Initial Market Cap!\r\n   \r\n\"I will add 0.2 bnb as an initial liquidity, and burn 50% from the start to create the blackhole, and after that i will burn the LP and renounce Ownership. Create the community by yourself if you are interested, i suggest you https://t.me/Hamtarobscofficial the words of founder\r\n\r\nGreat features:\r\n5% fee auto add to the liquidity pool to locked forever when selling\r\n2% fee auto distribute to all holders. I set 7% tax fee for STRONG HOLDERS.\r\n50% burn to the black hole, with such big black hole and 5% fee, the strong holder will get a valuable reward.\r\nAlso there is antiwhale system, limiting the max transaction to 0.5% of the total number of tokens every buy and sell.\r\n\r\nCurrently in circulation there are 500,000,000,000,000 tokens because which 50% have already been burned as can be seen from BSCscan. Each transaction has 7% of itself as fees of which 5% is burned and the rest distributed among the holders as a reward.\r\nThe founders have given up on tokens and do not own any.\r\nWe are a solid community that truly believes in the project.\r\n\r\nCurrently the team remains anonymous and we believe that over time the community will take over the project.", "dateAdded":
