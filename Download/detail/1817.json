{"data": {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "symbol": "VGX", "slug": "voyager-token", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Voyager Token (VGX)?\n\nVoyager Token is a cryptocurrency broker that provides investors with a trusted and secure access point to crypto asset trading. Voyager is built to serve both retail and institutional investors with a nigh-instant solution for trading crypto assets.\n\nThe crypto brokerage service which launched in October 2018 now supports over 55 crypto assets and has a unique smart order routing technology that connects it with over a dozen crypto exchanges. The mobile app of the Voyager Token launched in January 2019, making it even easier for users to trade cryptos.\n\nThe native token of the brokerage, Voyager Token (VGX), is used to reward users within the Voyager ecosystem. VGX also generates interest when held in the Voyager app, offers cashback rewards, and other services exclusive to Voyager users.\n\nVoyager also offers 100 percent commission-free transactions \u2013 including buying and selling. Traders only have to pay only the quoted price when executing an order on the platform.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Voyager Token?\n\nCrypto Trading Technologies, the mother company of Voyager Token is led by a group with experience in online brokerage services. The project was jointly founded by Stephen Ehrlich, Philip Eytan, Gaspard de Dreuzy, and Oscar Salazar.\n\nStephen Ehrlich, the Chief Executive Officer of the foundation is a veteran in the brokerage and financial market specializing in developing trading platforms for equity and options traders. He is the founder of Lightspeed Financial and former CEO of E*TRADE Professional Trading LLC.\n\nChairman of the Voyager Foundation, Philip Eytan, started as a Telecom M&A analyst at Morgan Stanley and portfolio manager at Cerberus Capital. He is the co-founder of the digital healthcare startup, Pager. He is one of the founding investors of Uber, Source, and Livestream.\n\nGaspard de Dreuzy serves as a board member for the Voyager Foundation. A veteran in the brokerage and financial market, he started his career as an advisor to Warner Music. He is also the co-founder of Kapitall, Trade.it, and Pager.\n\nOscar Salazar is an investor and experienced developer of customer-driven mobile applications. He is best known for being the founding architect and Chief Technical Officer of UBER. He is also a co-founder of the digital healthcare startup.\n\n\n## What Makes Voyager Token Unique?\n\nVoyager has created a network for crypto trading that feels remarkably similar to clients traditional online brokerages enjoy. Voyager launched its mobile app in 2019 to bring an easy, yet efficient crypto brokerage service to smartphone users.\n\nVoyager Token uses a Smart Order Routing technology that takes advantage of discrepancies between listed prices on cryptocurrency exchanges. This technology helps it connect instantly with over a dozen crypto exchanges for investors to choose the best exchange rate available for their transactions.\n\nThis feature also means that investors can also evaluate the spreads between bid and ask prices and higher levels of liquidity across different crypto exchanges. For traders, it becomes much easier to enter and exit positions.\n\nAlthough the platform offers professional trading services, it remains very easy to use. The order submission is assisted by Voyager's Smart Order Routing. After selecting a coin or token, the order type, and the amount of the asset to be purchased in USD, Voyager's Smart Order Routing automatically fills out the order.\n\nRelated Pages:\n\n[Find out about Troy (TROY)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/troy/)\n\n[Nine things to know before investing in cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/9-things-to-know-before-investing-in-cryptocurrency)\n\n[Learn about cryptocurrency with CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/9-things-to-know-before-investing-in-cryptocurrency)\n\n[Read the latest posts on the CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n\n## How Many Voyager Tokens (VGX) Are There in Circulation?\n\nLike the native tokens of other crypto brokerage platforms, the Voyager Tokens have all been issued.
