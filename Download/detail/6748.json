{"data": {"id": 6748, "name": "Centrifuge", "symbol": "CFG", "slug": "centrifuge", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Centrifuge (CFG)?\n\nCentrifuge is a decentralized asset financing protocol. It connects decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) with real-world assets (RWA) while trying to lower the cost of capital for small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) and provide investors with a stable source of income. The main goal of the project is to generate profits that are not tied to volatile crypto assets; the developers are pursuing the task of transferring real monetary value from fiat to cryptocurrencies.\n\nCompanies are using Centrifuge to access the liquidity that DeFi has to offer. They can tokenize real assets and use these tokens as collateral to access financing through Tinlake, a decentralized application ([DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) lending protocol. The Centrifuge blockchain is built on Polkadot ([DOT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/)) for speed and low fees, while its financial DApp Tinlake is built to access Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) liquidity. \n\nCentrifuge provides liquidity to everyone and investors receive income and rewards in the form of CFG tokens. Centrifuge links assets such as invoices, real estate and royalties with decentralized finance (DeFi). Additionally, borrowers benefit from the fact that they can finance their real assets without banks or other intermediaries.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Centrifuge?\n\nCentrifuge was launched in 2017 by Lucas Vogelsang and Martin Quensel.\n\nLucas Vogelsang is the founding engineer at Centrifuge and holds the position of the company\u2019s CEO. Vogelsang co-founded e-commerce startup DeinDeal in 2010. After successfully selling DeinDeal to Ringier, he started working on another startup \u2014 KaufDA. Later, Vogelsang relocated to Silicon Valley to join Taulia as technical manager. In October 2017, he co-founded Centrifuge.\n\nMartin Quensel is a co-founder at Centrifuge and its current COO. Prior to Centrifuge, he co-founded Taulia. Quensel began his career at SAP as a software developer and architect.\n\n\n#### What Makes Centrifuge (CFG) Unique?\n\nThe Centrifuge protocol tokenizes real-world assets by converting them to non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token)). After that, they are funded through Tinlake. Tinlake is the first DApp built on the Centrifuge chain. It was created to access liquidity on Ethereum, while CFG has its own bridge to Ethereum.\n\nThe features of Centrifuge include integration with other DeFi protocols. This feature allows Centrifuge users to get liquidity without slowdowns and protects DeFi protocols from destabilizing events by adding uncorrelated collateral. As a result, the cumulative risks are reduced and predatory lending and banks are replaced by [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).\n\nAs of June 2021, Centrifuge has the highest total value locked (TVL) on the Polkadot ecosystem. Moreover, the project claims to be among the first to launch a [parachain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-parachains-2) on Polkadot. When the team designed the Centrifuge chain, operational speed and low fees were prioritized.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [Aave](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/).\n\nLearn more about [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi).\n\nWhat is Polkadot?

There are three major use cases for CFG: staking, paying transaction fees and governance participation. The token is also used to reward the liquidity providers on Tinlake. As of June 2021, the total supply is 425,000,000 CFG, growing at a rate of 3% per year.\n\nThe total supply of CFG tokens are distributed as follows: 27% to core contributors, 17.1% to total backers, 7.3% to rewards and grants, 9.5% to the community sale, 11.8% to foundation endowment, 7.1% to community grants, 10.8% to development grants and 8.3% to the early ecosystem.\n\nCFG sale took place on May 26, 2021, on Coinlist. The event was held in two stages and the supply of tokens was limited at 17 million for each round.\n\n\n### How Is the Centrifuge Network Secured?\n\nUsers pay transaction fees in CFG tokens and transaction aggregators on Polkadot receive a share of the fee for processing and storing data. These measures, as well as the NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake) mechanism and the CFG rewards, encourage users to operate fairly and select data collators that provide censorship resistance.\n\nOverall, most of the security comes from the Polkadot relay chain. The use of Polkadot's protective mechanisms provides Centrifuge with a high level of security at a low cost.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Centrifuge (CFG)?\n\nAs of June 2021, CFG tokens can be traded on the [BitZ](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitz/) platform.\n\nIf you want to find out more about buying crypto, feel free to read our detailed [guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).\n\n", "dateAdded": "2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "icoStatus": "active_ico", "notice": "Bitz is trading IOU version of this token and not the official CFG asset.
