Tranchess provides a different risk/return matrix out of a single main fund that tracks a specific underlying asset. The name Tranchess was inspired by the game of chess, as well as the French word \u201cTranche\u201d, which is often associated with tranche funds that caters to different class of investors with varying risk appetite. Tranchess was launched on 24th June 2021.\n\nThe main fund, aka token Queen, tracks a specific underlying asset and can be split equally into 2 sub funds. We have purposefully chosen BTC as the first crypto asset to track. Meanwhile, it also shares many of the popular DeFi features such as: single-asset yield farming, borrowing & lending, trading, etc.\n\nTranchess provides: \n\n-\tEnhanced yield returns without incurring impermanent losses\n-\tLeveraged positions at low cost and no forced liquidation\n-\tZero Lock-in Period for Queen holders\n-\tPrevention of Oracle Attacks using TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)\n\nRelated Pages:\ntranchess.medium.com\n\n\n##Who Are the Founders of Tranchess Protocol?\n\nTranchess Protocol is the brainchild of Co-Founder Danny Chong and Team. The concept was incepted in 2020 with a team across diverse experiences and roles in tech firms such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft to Investment Banks such as Morgan Stanley, UBS and BNP Paribas. \n\nOur tech team is particularly experienced with cyber security in trading and DeFi protocols, their knowledge in smart contract coding is additive to the maintenance and upgrades in years to come.\n\nDanny himself had worked at both BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, holding positions across his career from trading, sales and management regionally in FICC space.  \n\nIt is the team\u2019s vision to empower users of DeFi with Omni Asset Management capabilities and contributing to the paradigm shift from Traditional Finance to DeFi. And in time, to offer a full product suite in Asset Management Protocols, tailored for DeFi users across risk capacities and appetites.\n\n##What makes Tranchess Unique?\n\nThe project leverages on smart contracts that makes it transparent and automated across processes. The protocol allows users to have enhanced earning while tracking BTC, earns extra interests by lending out their tokens, or enjoying leverage with no forced liquidation. Users also get a share of platform earnings as part of their staking returns. Tranchess ecosystem allows gain from both NAV and yield perspectives. \n\n\n##How is Tranchess Protocol Secured?\n\nOur smart contracts do not rely on price feeds from other smart contracts and thus are highly resistant to price manipulation such as flash loan attacks. Tranchess price oracle uses 30-minute TWAP instead of discrete oracle price. This minimizes the possibility of oracle manipulation attack. Tranchess oracle extends the Open Oracle standard by Compound, accepts signed price data from two separate sources (Coinbase and OKEX) and computes time-weighted average price (TWAP) in every 30-minute epoch.\n\nOther security measures includes: Multiple rounds of code audit by reputable teams (Peckshield & Certik), Bug Bounty (Immunefi) and Multi-signature settings. \n\n##How many CHESS Tokens are in circulation?\n\nChess Tokens has a max supply of 300 million with following allocation:\n5% seed investors, 20% core team, 15% reserved for future investors, 50% liquidity mining, 10% Treasury. \n\n300,000 from Treasury are released through Pancakeswap\u2019s liquidity pool. \n\nCHESS emission as below:\n\n\tFor Week 1-4, 300,000 on the first week, and each new week thereafter adds 300,000 new tokens additionally on top of previous week\u2019s distribution.\n\n\tWeek 5 distributes 2,400,000 tokens.\n\n\tFor Week 6-20, starts from 2,304,000 and decreases by 4% each week onwards.\n\n\tRemaining distribution to be decided later.\n\n\n##Where Can I Buy Tranchess Protocol (CHESS)?\n\nCHESS is available for trading on Pancakeswap from 8 July 2021. \nIt would be available on other exchanges later.", "dateAdded": "2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:54:39.000Z", "watchCount": "515", "dateLaunched":
