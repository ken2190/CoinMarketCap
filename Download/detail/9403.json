{"data": {"id": 9403, "name": "WOOF PACK", "symbol": "WOOF", "slug": "woof-pack", "category": "token", "description": "Launched on 9th of April 2021 this DeFi token based around dogs was released on the bep20 blockchain as a token. A community team from across the globe adopted this project and hope to help out dogs globally! \r\nhttps://woofpackcoin.com/\r\n\r\nThe initial supply of woof was 1 trillion however half of this was burnt at the start to help the coin  hold more value. Woof also deploys Tokenomics which charges the owner a 10% upon selling the coin. This 10% is split into two parts\r\n-5% reflected back to holders of the token \r\n-5% returned back into a locked liquidity pool\r\nThus rewarding holders and discouraging sellers to help increase the value of the coin over time.\r\n\r\nWe are also exploring ways of implementing a donation wallet. This wallet controlled by a charity of choice will allow members to donate woof for the charities to either hold or sell in order to help fund them!\r\n\r\nThe admin team comprises of 6 community members which may be expanded at any time.\r\n-Nicolaj Niksi\u0107, 31, Germany\r\n-Tom Garner, 18, UK\r\n-Julia Trzpis-Nowacka, 29, Poland\r\n-Mikkel Thomsen, 18, Denmark\r\n-Andre Pitout, 29, South Africa\r\n-Jerry Domingues, 37, USA\r\nMembers from almost all corners of the globe means our team is active 24 hours a day and can help translate when communicating with other countries. \r\n\r\nWhere to buy\r\nWe are currently listed on pancake swap as a bep20 token! \r\nhttps://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8887917b46f71dbcb5e895e85887dc2eaa64b22a", "dateAdded": "2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "121", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["http://woofpackcoin.com/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x8887917b46f71dbcb5e895e85887dc2eaa64b22a"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/woofpacktoken"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/WoofPackOfficial?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/WoofPack9?s=09"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.51961028446848, "priceChangePercentage24h": 40.05897643, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.08756307}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.09993818062774, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.86982167, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.75462837}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04639215361782, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13811962, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76587648}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34600204194768, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.31417693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.96994307}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08817176397124, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.22152403, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.30137851}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33359854728193, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.66084021, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.68392023}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.62329345078651, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.8204927, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.27014225}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12773403744909, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.63156837, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.11450108}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04584695150604, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.05885686, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.83521981}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:34:36.423Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
