{"data": {"id": 5203, "name": "Perth Mint Gold Token", "symbol": "PMGT", "slug": "perth-mint-gold-token", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is PMGT?\n\n\nPerth Mint Gold Token (PMGT), launched in October 2018, is an ERC20 token developed and issued by Trovio. Each unit represents 1 fine troy ounce of physical gold securely stored in The Perth Mint's central bank grade vaults. \n\nPMGT is a tokenized version of GoldPass certificates issued by The Perth Mint. GoldPass is The Perth Mint\u2018s full-service gold investment platform that digitizes physical gold in the form of digital certificates. \n\nPMGT is tradeable on Independent Reserve, transferable peer to peer, and enables a smart contract proving your title of gold held at the Perth Mint. \n\n## Who Are the Founders of PMGT?\n\nPMGT is an Trovio product, issued by Trovio, while GoldPass is a Perth Mint product. The Perth Mint is the custodian of the underlying physical gold behind all GoldPass digital certificates, including those held by Trovio which back PMGT.\n\n## What Makes PMGT Unique?\n\nPMGT claims to be 100% backed by gold held and stored in The Perth Mint\u2019s central bank grade vaults, where the weight and purity of every ounce are guaranteed by the Government of Western Australia. This makes PMGT the first gold-backed token on a public blockchain whereby the physical gold is government guaranteed.\n\nAs PMGT is a tokenized version of GoldPass certificates backed by physical gold held in The Perth Mint\u2019s inventory, the issuance of PMGT can seamlessly scale up to billions of dollars\u2019 worth of tokens.\n\nFree of recurring storage or management fees, PMGT offers institutional investors a competitive alternative to traditional gold products, with the additional benefits of real-time 24/7 trading, a cryptographically secure instant settlement enabled by blockchain technology, and fewer intermediaries.\n\n## How Many PMGT Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total circulating supply of PMGT is 548.90253. There are no tokens set aside, locked up or otherwise sitting with a token holder that are not considered to be in full circulation.\n\n## Where Can You Buy PMGT?\n\nPMGT may be bought and sold under the ticker symbol PMGT on Independent Reserve for AUD, USD, and NZD. It is recommended that you store your PMGT in an ERC20 compatible Ethereum wallet. Trovio is in discussions with a number of other popular exchanges and details about further listings should be announced soon.\n\n## Vision/Mission\n\nTrovio launched PMGT with the mission of making an investment in, and distribution of, gold assets far more widely available. PMGT is the closest a customer can get to buying physical gold \u2013 much closer than ETFs or other products based on futures, leveraged positions, future production, or gold held by solution providers. \n\nLaunch date: 10th October 2019\n\n## Value proposition and the pain point that it solves: \n\nFree of recurring storage or management fees, PMGT offers institutional investors a competitive alternative to traditional gold products, with the additional benefits of real-time 24/7 trading, a cryptographically secure instant settlement enabled by blockchain technology, and fewer intermediaries.\n\nPreviously, the only way to invest in gold involved buying from a vault and paying storage fees, or through an ETF. While ETFs are traditionally listed on share markets and adhere to strict share market trading rules, PMGT is based on blockchain-based technology, which allows for many contrasting characteristics and makes gold accessible to a wider audience.  The technology allows for: 24/7 trading; multiple exchange listings; peer-to-peer transfers; cross-listings against all FIAT/crypto listed on an exchange; instantaneous settlement on all transactions.\n\n\n## Technology\n\nThe PMGT is an ERC20 compliant token on the Ethereum network, ensuring ease-of-use and accessibility for investors and exchanges alike, and has additional smart contract features for the purposes of security and regulation. In the interest of stability, security, and long-term maintainability, the PMGT implementation needs to be upgradeable so Trovio can resolve vulnerabilities and respond to identified risks, add new features and functionality, and improve the system and optimize its operational efficiency. \n\nSmart contract upgradeability is achieved by grouping individual smart contracts to interoperate as a cohesive system. The ZeppelinOS proxy pattern is used to provide a permanent smart contract address for users to interact with while allowing the PMGT implementation and business logic to be upgraded over time. \n\nThe smart contract code has been developed using robust, battle-tested open-source libraries such as OpenZeppelin and ZeppelinOS. Sigma Prime \u2013 a leading blockchain and cybersecurity firm \u2013 has performed an independent smart contract security review of Trovio implementation and security model. Human operated keys are stored offline in tamper-resistant security tokens. System process operated keys are stored online in encrypted keystores, with system permissions that restrict the usage of the key to only specific processes.\n\n## Team/Backers/Investors\n\n* Jon
