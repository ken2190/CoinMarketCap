DeFi100 (D100) is a synthetic index fund protocol and a rebase project on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/bsc/)). It is a pseudo-stable cryptocurrency managed via a so-called rebase that takes place every day.\n\nIt was designed to reflect the capitalization of and to serve as an investment vehicle for the entire DeFi market. It can also be used as a speculative asset by traders.\n\nDeFi100 presale took place in the last week of February 2021 on the BSC [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) Launchpad.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of DeFi100?\n\nDeFi100 claims to be the first rebase project on[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BinanceSmartChain&src=hashtag_click)the Binance Smart Chain. It was launched by [Wrapp3d](https://wrapp3d.com/), a group of developers who design and adopt synthetic assets. Their main goal is to introduce indices and tradable assets to the crypto token economy. The team works anonymously. \n\n\n#### What Makes DeFi100 (D100) Unique?\n\nDeFi100 is a digital asset with a capitalization that is based on the total DeFi industry market cap at the ratio of 1:100 billion. \n\nThe process of rebasing takes place when the spot price of DeFi100 is not in balance with its target price. Rebase can be positive (the spot price is above the target price, so the token supply expands to lower the spot price) or negative (the spot price is below the target price, so the token supply decreases).\n\nThe D100 token is pegged to the value of the total DeFi market cap, which changes every day. The role of the rebase function is to keep DeFi100 pegged to the DeFi market cap.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/).\n\nLearn more about [Ampleforth](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ampleforth/).\n\nRead more about decentralized finance at [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance).\n\nFor the latest crypto news, visit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many DeFi100 (D100) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe D100 token follows a pattern of elastic supply. The rebase function is used regularly to achieve a balance between the spot price and the target price.\n\nDeFi100 was launched with a circulating supply of 2,500,000 tokens. Bidding was available at BakerySwap, and the tokens were distributed immediately after the presale. Added liquidity is locked for 11 months, starting in February 2021.\n\nOf the total D100 supply, 5% was reserved for the team, 25% was allocated to liquidity pool staking and farming, 20% to liquidity mining (of which 8% is the ecosystem reserve and 12% is liquidity) and the remaining tokens were allocated to the public sale.\n\n\n### How Is the DeFi100 Network Secured?\n\nDeFi100 (D100) is a BSC-based BEP-20 token. D100 receives price data using decentralized [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles) from the Decentralised Information Asset (DIA). Using these feeds allows D100 to execute rebasing every 24 hours.\n\nOracles are essential to D100\u2019s operation, as they provide smart contracts with off-chain data, serving as adapters between blockchain and the real world.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy DeFi100 (D100)?\n\nD100 tokens can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/)\n*   [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/)\n*   [BakerySwap ](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bakeryswap/)\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?
