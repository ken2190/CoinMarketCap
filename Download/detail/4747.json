In the heart of our Ecosystem is AI technology, which leverages blockchain by optimizing its performance and assisting other products to function.\n\nRecently named one of the top 23 crypto valley companies by CV VC and PWC report, Velas is designed to eliminate the scaling and usability issues that often come along with cryptocurrencies.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Velas\n\n[Velas Network AG](https://www.velas.com/) is an ecosystem startup based in Switzerland. It was founded in 2019 by Canadian citizen [Alex Alexandrov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ervichov/), a prominent blockchain and crypto entrepreneur, and investor. He is also a founder of [CoinPayments](https://www.coinpayments.net/) --- the world's #1 payment gateway for cryptocurrencies; advisor and investor of [Mind AI](https://mind.ai/) --- a well-known Korean AI startup. Alex is consulting the FBI, Europol and several national governments on technology, cybersecurity, blockchain, and AI implementation.\n\n### What Makes Velas Unique?\n\n- AI Powered Blockchain - the next-generation blockchain framework that enables processing speeds of 50,000+TPS.\n\n-  Supports Solidity -- supports all smart contracts and dApps built on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\n-   Instant, low-cost transactions - extremely efficient performance at a fraction of the cost.\n\n-   Velas Account - interaction with cryptocurrencies is facilitated to the level of PayPal-like convenience, without sacrificing on our user's security.\n\n-   Access Management - a decentralized access management system, which allows users to control access to files on IPFS using multiple encryption types.\n\n-   Velas Vault -\u00a0 a novel security solution that allows users to easily distribute the security of their funds and information to established market participants such as Google and Apple.\n\n-   Velas Wallet - multi-currency Wallet with staking functionality.\n\n-   MicroApps - building out its dApp capabilities, Velas will soon support cross-platform decentralized applications for mobile devices.\n\n### How Is the Velas Network Secured?\n\nCurrently, there is a dilemma in the industry - how to make blockchain both secure and scalable. Therefore, Velas is working to add an AI module as an additional layer to prevent known attacks by slowing down the blockchain when an attack on the system is in progress, and accelerating the system when there is no malicious behavior in the network.\n\nTo achieve the optimal balance of speed, throughput, and security, a novel consensus system, known as AIDPoS, will use machine learning to automatically adapt the Velas blockchain to changing circumstances, ensuring maximum performance and resilience at all times.\n\n### How Many VLX Are There in Circulation?\n\nVelas AIDPoS consensus is based on DPoS economics, and AI does not affect tokenomics at all. A set of rules has been established to provide participants with the most favorable conditions for interaction with each other and motivate them to act for the benefit of the network.\n\nBasic VLX metrics:\n\n-   Total supply - 2,124,380,663 VLX\n\n-   Circulating Supply - 2,124,380,663 VLX\n\n-   Inflation rate - 8% with a decrease of 1.5% each year\n\n### What Can VLX Be Used For?\n\nVelas coin (VLX) is used for transactions, payments, fees and for supporting Proof-of-Stake consensus. Staking allows block producers (validators and their delegators) to provide transaction consensus and receive staking incentives for honest block production.\n\n#decentralisation #Blockchain #AI
