{"data": {"id": 5665, "name": "Helium", "symbol": "HNT", "slug": "helium", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Helium (HNT)?\n\nHelium (HNT) is a decentralized blockchain-powered network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \n\nLaunched in July 2019, the Helium mainnet allows low-powered wireless devices to communicate with each other and send data across its network of nodes.\n\nNodes come in the form of so-called Hotspots, which are a combination of a wireless gateway and a blockchain mining device. Users who operate nodes thus mine and earn rewards in Helium\u2019s native [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) token, HNT.\n\nHelium\u2019s goal is to prepare IoT communication for the future, identifying inadequacies in current infrastructure from its birth in 2013.\n\n\n### Who Are The Founders Of Helium?\n\nHelium\u2019s three co-founders Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning and Sean Carey started the company in 2013.\n\nHaleem has an active eSports and game development background. Fanning, by contrast, is well known for developing Napster, the music sharing service which was one of the first mainstream peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) internet services in the late 1990s.\n\nCarey meanwhile held multiple development roles prior to Helium, which included advertising optimization firm Where, acquired by PayPal.\n\nHelium\u2019s team now consists of members which the company says have experience in \u201cradio and hardware, manufacturing, distributed systems, peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies.\u201d\n\n\n#### What Makes Helium Unique?\n\nHelium aims to improve the communication capabilities of wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In 2013, infrastructure around IoT was still in its infancy, but developers wanted to add decentralization to their offering, hence referring to it as \u201cThe People\u2019s Network\u201d in official literature.\n\nIts core appeal will be to device owners and those interested in the IoT space, with financial incentives providing further outreach possibilities.\n\nNetwork participants purchase Hotspots \u2014 a combination of a wireless gateway and a miner \u2014 or build their own. Each hotspot provides network coverage over a certain radius, and also mines Helium\u2019s native token, HNT.\n\nThe network runs on proof-of-coverage, a new [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm based on the HoneyBadger BFT protocol which allows nodes in a network to reach consensus when connection quality is highly variable. \n\nIn addition to HNT, users pay transaction fees in a separate token called Data Credits, which are not exchangeable and tied to individual users themselves.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about IOTA [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/).\n\nRead more about IOTW [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iotw/).\n\nCrypto newbie?

This adjustment mechanism for token distribution is expected to last for around 20 years.\n\nAs of the start of October 2020, there are 48,712,218 HNT in circulation. When the token launched, the supply was zero, with no premine.\n\n\n### How Is the Helium Network Secured?\n\nHelium uses a bespoke consensus mechanism called proof-of-coverage (PoC) which rewards users for contributing to mining (validating transactions) and ensuring stability.\n\nPoC is based on the HoneyBadger BFT protocol, which is specifically designed for node communication when conditions are unreliable.\n\nHelium says that the most likely attack vector impacts node operators in the form of inbound ports of Hotspots. For token holders, the platform\u2019s own wallet uses asymmetric keys to help users with private key security.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Helium (HNT)?\n\nHNT is a tradable token spreading across major exchanges as of October 2020. Major pairs are active on [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and FTX, and include USD and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT). \n\nNew to crypto?
