{"data": {"id": 10363, "name": "MEMEX", "symbol": "MEMEX", "slug": "memex-exchange", "category": "token", "description": "MEMEX is the first cross-chain token with an automated market-making (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX), Yield Farming, and Staking platform on Binance Smart Chain fully dedicated to hosting only MEME-themed tokens.\r\n\r\nIt's fast, cheap, and anyone can use it. \r\n\r\nWhy MEME tokens?\r\n\r\nSimple. There is a huge demand for such projects, like gambling, people are looking for HIGH RISK/ HIGH REWARD new projects to invest in. Why don't we just host them under one hood?\r\n\r\nThe volume generated by trading MEME-themed tokens is amazing, more than $1.3+ BILLION volume in just 24h. MEMEX holders and Liquidity Providers will benefit fully out of fees generated by our DEX.\r\n\r\nMEMEX  will charge 0.30% of each swap that is happening on DEX and distributes equally to each Liquidity provider based on the % share they own. \r\nWhat issue MEMEX is going to solve?\r\n\r\n1. Due to the high number of tokens being created lately, most of them find hard time to list on \"Cryptocurrency Prices by Market Cap\" websites and gain exposure by getting lost in a large number of other projects.\r\n\r\nMEMEX is creating its own \"Cryptocurrency Prices by Market Cap\" website called MeMarketcap.com that is already purchased and ready to start the development.\r\n\r\n    According to Alexa, the internet traffic monitoring website, CoinMarketCap is the 570th most popular site in the world. Binance, in comparison, is ranked 1,691. The Block also notes that CoinMarketCap receives 80% more traffic than Binance.\r\n    https://coingeek.com/binance-rumored-to-acquire-coinmarketcap-for-400m/\u200b\r\n\r\n2. Another big issue MEMEX is going to solve is the exposure MEME tokens lack when a simple user is browsing the Uniswap, since those tokens can't be listed on Top Market Watching websites, they are invisible to 98% of potential users.\r\n\r\n3. ADS, all hate them but love when they help on finding a token that ends up a profitable trade. MEMEX will have a dedicated HOME page, pretty similar to Dextools where users will be able to view trending MEME tokens and sponsored ones.\r\nWhat is $MEMEX?\r\n\r\n$MEMEX is the native currency to MEMEX.EXCHANGE. It's required to participate in most of our initiatives, liquidity mining campaigns, and liquidity pools.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-09T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:51:03.000Z", "watchCount": "24966", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-24T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://memex.exchange"], "technical_doc": ["https://docs.memex.exchange"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0xf4a037785b3ae6c70f9ed71fa2084b3589cabd46"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/MEMEX-EXCHANGE"], "message_board": ["https://t.me/MemexOfficial", "https://memex-exchange.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/MemexOfficial"], "announcement": ["https://t.me/MemexAnnouncements"], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/MEMEX_EXCHANGE"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/MEMEX_EXCHANGE"]}, "volume": 0.0, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "statistics": {"price": 0.01696587214555, "priceChangePercentage1h": 0.4267009, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.45572503, "priceChangePercentage7d": 8.83024618, "priceChangePercentage30d": -49.02546773, "priceChangePercentage60d": 0.0, "priceChangePercentage90d": 0.0, "marketCap": 0.0, "marketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "fullyDilutedMarketCap": 169658.72, "fullyDilutedMarketCapChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "circulatingSupply": 0.0, "totalSupply": 0.0, "maxSupply": 10000000.0, "marketCapDominance": 0.0, "rank": 5770, "low24h": 0.01587717, "high24h": 0.01711699, "low7d": 0.0150063, "high7d": 0.01711699, "low30d": 0.01308028, "high30d": 0.04352565, "low90d": 0.01308028, "high90d": 0.24671186, "low52w": 0.01308028, "high52w": 0.24671186, "lowAllTime": 0.01308028, "highAllTime": 0.24671186, "lowAllTimeChangePercentage": 29.71, "highAllTimeChangePercentage": -93.12, "lowAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-07-20T10:08:06.000Z", "highAllTimeTimestamp": "2021-06-09T19:16:03.000Z", "lowYesterday": 0.01587717, "highYesterday": 0.01671199, "openYesterday": 0.01623252, "closeYesterday": 0.01636241, "priceChangePercentageYesterday": 0.8, "volumeYesterday": 0, "ytdPriceChangePercentage": 0.0}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xf4a037785b3ae6c70f9ed71fa2084b3589cabd46", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xf4a037785b3ae6c70f9ed71fa2084b3589cabd46", "contractDecimals": 8, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.93913845067335, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10541915, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.63438799}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33773955512395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.23981776, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.41715042}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04592046794645, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.23029735, "priceChangePercentage7d": 17.9758293}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08803051270921, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32754572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.77415107}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.86320486217138, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.14307618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6744906}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884102685655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.39973257, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44788409}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false, "holders": {}}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:51:39.942Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
