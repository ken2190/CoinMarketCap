{"data": {"id": 9781, "name": "BGOV", "symbol": "BGOV", "slug": "bgov", "category": "token", "description": "BGOV is a new BEP20 asset on Binance Smart Chain. BGOV is a fork of the Sushi token contract, and has an inflationary issuance model. This will make bZx the first lending AMM with Sushi-like token economics. BGOV allows bZx to experiment with interactive multi token models. Additionally, because the BGOV token model is capped at 250m, it gives us more latitude to experiment with liquidity incentives via farming. Furthermore, this allows us to create ongoing liquidity for vBZRX and BZRX, which will in turn drive value to BZRX token holders. All together, this opens the door to experiment with new strategies to increase TVL and drive rates down.\r\n\r\nIssuance: A capped 250m supply modeled after SUSHI, farming rewards will be available in perpetuity. Enabling reward support for new BSC assets.\r\nFarming: BGOV holders will be able to continue farming blockchain governance tokens (BGOV, and future tokens), with a greater multiplier compared to iToken farming. In order to achieve this, BGOV holders take their BGOV within the BGOV pool on BSC.\r\nStaking Protocol Fees: BGOV stakers will be able to stake their BGOV tokens within the BGOV pool and earn a portion of protocol fees generated from BSC margin trending, lending, and borrowing activity.\r\nGovernance: BGOV is used to govern Binance Smart Chain protocol parameters for Binance specific assets on bZx and submit governance proposals for Binance Smart chain protocol assets. Holders of BGOV are more aligned with and attentive to the health of Binance chain lending pools when it comes to governance decisions and proposals. BSC governance impacts the BSC community. As the value of the Ethereum deployment grows relative to that on BSC, this could result in BSC stakeholders having their voices diluted, and vice versa.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-13T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "47", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://bzx.network/"], "technical_doc": ["https://bzx.network/blog/bgov-tokenomics"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/bZxNetwork"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/bzxnetwork"], "chat": [], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/bzxHQ"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.14770510434796, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.12304848, "priceChangePercentage7d": 53.83680601}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.08948521717125, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.05496242, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.50256086}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0463266287478, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.13415688, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.4756861}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34158907038751, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.96859664, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.45374901}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08827561295395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.52347736, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.42732901}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33218429865312, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.34412525, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.45266776}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.65780294191658, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.60956613, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.69376176}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12744789978998, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.21786754, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.8643341}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04507747416068, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.01797293, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.73429399}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:37:17.763Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
