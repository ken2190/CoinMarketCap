{"data": {"id": 2566, "name": "Ontology", "symbol": "ONT", "slug": "ontology", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Ontology ($ONT)?\n\nOntology is a high performance, open source blockchain specializing in [digital identity and data](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity-a-deep-dive-by-ontology). Ontology's unique infrastructure supports robust cross-chain collaboration and Layer 2 scalability, offering businesses the flexibility to design a blockchain that suits their needs. With a suite of decentralized identity and data sharing protocols to enhance speed, security, and trust, Ontology\u2019s features include ONT ID, a mobile digital ID application and DID used throughout the ecosystem, and DDXF, a decentralized data exchange, and collaboration framework\n\nAt its launch, Ontology chose to forego the popular [initial coin offering (ICO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) model in favor of a series of community distributions and airdrops of its ONT [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), which began life as a NEP-5 token on the [NEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/) blockchain. \n\nThis helped to quickly establish both organic price discovery and a passionate community and helped the project to avoid subsequent regulatory scrutiny.\n\nFor example, for a brief period any person who signed up for the Ontology newsletter received an airdrop of free 1,000 ONT, which reached a value of $10 per token soon after the token became listed on major exchanges like [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/). \n\nOntology [launched its own MainNet](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched) on June 30, 2018 and now operates independently from the NEO blockchain. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Ontology?\n\nOntology was established by Li Jun, Founder of Ontology. During Ontology\u2019s early stages of development, Ontology received technical support from some members of Onchain\u2019s developer team. However, the two have always been officially separate projects pursuing their own goals. \n\n## What Makes Ontology Unique?\n\nOntology offers a variety of real-life use cases and allows businesses to build their own blockchain on top of the Ontology blockchain. \n\nImportantly, Ontology offers more flexibility for enterprises, allowing them to create customized blockchains to fit their specific needs in terms of features like governance and enhanced privacy, functionality that competitors like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and NEO lack by design.\n\nThe ONT chain also helps negate [transaction network fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) by generating and distributing free [Ontology Gas (ONG)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/) to ONT holders based on their holdings. \n\nOntology further provides additional features such as smart contracts, cryptographic identity proofs (ONT ID) and tokenized data (DDXF) that can seamlessly be transferred between different blockchains. \n\nExample: A patient's medical records, subject to strict data privacy laws in most countries, may be utilized across the Ontology network without compromising the integrity and privacy of the patient's data. The medical business that is transferring the confidential data is able to control what is shared with other parties and under which conditions, with no fear of patient data falling into the hands of unauthorized parties. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn more about [NEO (NEO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/).\n\nLearn more about [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). \n\nLearn more about [Ontology Gas (ONG)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/)<sup>.</sup>\n\nVisit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) for trending blockchain news and insights. \n\n\n## How Many Ontology (ONT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nOntology has a total coin supply of 1,000,000,000 ONT, of which nearly 80% are currently in circulation. \n\nAt its launch, 15% of ONT tokens were allocated to its core team, 10% to the NEO council, 28% to institutional partners, 10% to its technical community and 25% to the development of its ecosystem.\n\nThese tokens were subject to a strict screening process and various unlocking periods that ran over two years until the end of October 2020. Read more about its [token distribution here](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-ont-token-distribution-and-circulating-supply-da96d5540827). \n\n\n### How Is the Ontology Network Secured?\n\nThe Ontology network is fully decentralized and therefore highly resistant against hacks, which would have to affect over half of the connected devices to make an impact. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Ontology (ONT)?\n\nBoth ONT and ONG are listed and supported by the world\u2019s leading exchanges such as [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), with the exception of Coinbase. It is now possible to [buy Ontology](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Ontology) and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin To find out how, [read more here](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-sell-crypto).",
