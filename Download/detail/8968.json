{"data": {"id": 8968, "name": "Polychain Monsters", "symbol": "PMON", "slug": "polkamon", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Polkamon (PMON)?\n\nPolkamon is essentially a trading game created using blockchain technology and borrowing the mechanics of the popular in the 90s Pok\u00e9mon cards trading. The right mix of nostalgia and technology, it was launched right into the [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) craze of Q1 2021. Each Polkamon digital monster is a collectible artifact with unique properties and rarity. PMON is a native ETH-20 token of the Polkamon platform, necessary if one wants to purchase new Polkamon or to unlock new features.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Polkamon](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-polkamon).\n\nPolkamon was founded in early March 2021 and it soon secured a $740,000 funding round from six strategic investors, led by Moonrock Capital and Morningstar Ventures. An [IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-dex-offering) (initial dex offering) event at Polkastarted on Mar. 31, 2021 has helped the founders raise approximately $100,000. Two weeks after launch, it has successfully placed itself among the [top ten](https://etherscan.io/topstat#Token) most used ETH tokens, burning millions only on gas fees.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Polkamon?\n\nPolkamon was founded by three software professionals from Bemen, Germany. Their names are Leif Eric Leiser, Lennart Brandt and Finn Hansen.\n\nLeif Eric Leiser is the team\u2019s CEO and software engineer. In parallel with Polkamon as of April 2021, he works as software engineer at a [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) platform Tixl.Finance and is running eco-shop chain Beleaf as co-founder and software engineer. However, before that, he has had a dozen short contract jobs and internships in software engineering and product development, including such companies as Philips, Lufthansa and Elbstack. He holds a master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering from Hamburg University of Technology, which he finished in 2018. \n\nLennart Brandt is Polkamon's chief marketing officer (CMO) and software developer. He is also known as the founder of JoinWeBurn.com, a relatively popular fitness app. Like Leiser, he works on Tixl.Finance in the position of a UX designer and up to founding Polkamon has also worked at Elbstack, a German software company, as a serial entrepreneur for various projects, playing roles of product designer and react native developer as well. He has a bachelor\u2019s in business informatics (BI) from IBS IT & Business School Oldenburg\n\nFinn Hansen is the third partner, who serves Polkamon as a full-stack software engineer. Along with the other two co-founders, he is employed at DeFi platform Tixl.Finance, where he holds the position of software engineer.\n\n\n#### What Makes Polkamon Unique?\n\nPolkamon combines several features that together make it almost a perfect match for the heated crypto market of 2021. When the infamous [CryptoKitties ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft#toc-what-are-cryptokitties-)broke out, the technology was not yet fully ready to embrace such a game, but four years since it is [different](https://cointelegraph.com/news/milking-the-cash-cow-nfts-seen-as-investment-opportunity-by-vcs): the infrastructure has significantly improved and was ready for the next wave of growth. \n\nThe mechanics of Polkamon trading is rather simple: there are collectible NFT Polkamons, there are \u201cBooster Packs'' to distribute new animated monsters, where you do not know which ones you\u2019ll get from the pack (just like in the 90s, yes), and finally there are PMON tokens to buy and trade them with.\n\nMoreover, initially Polkamons in the Booster Packs are not yet full-fledged NFTs, they are what the developers call \u201csoft-minted.\u201d If a user decides to turn his Polkamon of choice into an NFT, he has to burn PMON tokens to mint it. Given that the total volume of tokens will decrease with every minted Polkamon NFT, their price is [designed to rise](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/deflation).\n\nThe project developers are planning to unveil a number of user features, including PMON [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking), full utilization of level-2 meta-data properties and cross-chain support with the power of [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot), all to enrich the gaming experience.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with NFTs?

However, another 20% are marketing and business development tokens, 20% of which are available before listing, the rest bound by daily vesting over 365 days. 20% are liquidity tokens with the same vesting schedule. \n\nFinally, only as much as 2.85% PMON tokens are public.\n\n\n### How Is the Polkamon Network Secured?\n\nPMON tokens are standard [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, while the Polkamons can be minted as [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721), a non-fungible token, meaning that it runs on and is secured by the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum, in turn, is secured by its Ethash [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) function.\n\nERC-20 merely defines a set of rules for tokens, as well as security considerations mainly related to the strength of the Ethereum network. For example, congestion can hike the price of [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) needed to perform transactions, leading to delays and abnormally high transaction fees, which impact all participants. This has already happened at the early days of Ethereum when in 2017 the first popular game based on smart contracts called CryptoKitties has completely clogged the network.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Polkamon (PMON)?\n\nLet us not be confused with several types of assets constituting the Polkamon universe. Polkamon collectible NFTs are traded at peer-to-peer marketplaces such as OpenSea.\n\nPMON tokens are available for trade at many crypto exchanges, the largest ones including [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), [1Inch](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/1inch-exchange/) Exchange and [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/). You can find others listed on our [crypto exchanges page](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/). \n\nTrading paris for PMON include stablecoins like [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) and other cryptocurrencies, especially [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Please do you own research before bringing you assets to an exchange.\n\nNew to crypto and want to learn how to buy [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC), or any other cryptocurrency?
