{"data": {"id": 2405, "name": "IOST", "symbol": "IOST", "slug": "iostoken", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is IOST (IOST)?\n\nIOST describes itself as an \u201cultra-fast,\u201d fully fledged and [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) [network](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/network) and ecosystem with its own nodes, [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/wallets) and based on the \u201cnext-generation\u201d [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) [protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/protocol) dubbed \u201cproof-of-believability.\u201d \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of IOST?\n\nThe project was launched in January 2018 by Jimmy Zhong, Terrence Wang, Justin Li, Ray Xiao, Sa Wang and Kevin Tan.\n\n \n\nZhong has founded other tech startups in the U.S. and China. During his university days, he sold his first company for $40 million \u2014 a marketplace where students could exchange class notes. After that, he returned to Beijing and co-founded IOST, among other projects.\n\nWang\u2019s previous experience includes serving as an Uber software engineer. He holds a degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota and a masters in computer science from Princeton University.\n\n \n\nLi previously worked as an investment banking associate at Goldman Sachs and a data scientist at Mobike. He graduated with a degree in applied mathematics and computer science. Meanwhile, Tan was a co-founder at Ethercap, while he received a degree in computer science from Tsinghua University.\n\n \n\nXiao co-founded Dora \u2014 alongside Jimmy and Sa \u2014 an AI company focused on intelligent kiosks. He studied computer science and quantitative economics at university.\n\n\n#### What Makes IOST Unique?\n\nIOST\u2019s blockchain infrastructure is open-source and designed to be secure and scalable \u2014 all in the hope that it will serve as the backbone for online services in the future.\n\nThe team have developed a \u201cproof-of-believability\u201d [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) [algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithm) to ensure [transactions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transaction-tx) on the network are secure and efficient.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that IOST aims to resolve centers on how big companies may not be able to embrace blockchains in a customer-facing environment unless they are scalable. The Internet of Services Token is put forward as a way of tackling this problem.\n\n \n\nTo understand IOST, the best way to do it is by comparing it to its nearest competitors: [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) is the most popular smart contract platform for developers. It can also be compared to [EOS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos) and [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron), which are highly scalable smart contract platforms with high usage.\n\n \n\nThe largest difference between IOST and its competitors is how it claims it can process up to 100,000 transactions per second compared with Ethereum\u2019s 20, Tron\u2019s 2,000 and EOS\u2019s 4,000. \n\nIn order to reach these transaction speeds, the IOST team has created a novel blockchain architecture, which introduces and combines several innovations including a Distributed Randomness Protocol, Efficient Distributed Sharding, TransEpoch, Atomix, Proof-of-Believability and Micro State Blocks.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\n[Learn more about cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria).\n\n[Stay up-to-date with the latest crypto headlines](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/).\n\n[Subscribe to the CoinMarketCap newsletter](https://coinmarketcap.com/newsletter/).\n\n\n#### How Many IOST (IOST) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nIOST has a total token supply of 21 billion. An ICO was held in January 2018 where 40% were sold, raising about $31.3 million worth of ETH at the time. \n\nAs for the remainder, 35% has been retained by the IOST Foundation, 12.5% was allocated to building the community, 10% went to the IOST team and 2.5% was dedicated to investors and advisors.\n\n\n### How Is the IOST Network Secured?\n\nIn order to compete with hundreds of niche blockchains, IOST relies heavily on its proof-of-believability protocol (PoB) and efficient distributed sharding (EDS) to improve the scalability and security of its blockchain. \n\nIOST is built for enterprise use, so it claims to be able to handle heavy loads produced by big tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. Partnerships appear to be key for the project\u2019s success.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy IOST (IOST)?\n\nIOST can be bought at many exchanges such as Bittrex, CoinEx, Livecoin, Binance and Bitrue.
