The customer pays in VEE tokens the price of the job (may as well use crypto or FIAT like a credit card in local currency as instant exchange feature is available), the tokens are stored in blockchain, and then if the smart contract conditions are met, the freelancer will be instantly paid; if not, the funds are returned to the customer. Veelancing charges the smallest fee on the market - 3% for any job completed on the platform, if not in a promotional period when fees are even smaller.\r\n\r\nBeing powered by blockchain technology, Veelancing wants to overcome the major issues of the current freelancing industry, by offering:\r\n\r\n\u2022complete transparency\r\n\u2022highly secure environment\r\n\u2022accessibility to all\r\n\u2022the bringing of the industry back to its P2P origins\r\n\u2022elimination of third-party mediation\r\n\u2022instant payments\r\n\u2022user voting for platform changes and new features\r\n\u2022minimal fees\r\n\u2022cold wallets\r\n \r\nVeelancing aims to create an environment where both freelncers and talent seekers may actually feel that the platform belongs to them. That's why we implemented a long series of features (the smallest fee, crypto-friendliness, voting rights for users, badges, achievements, token bonuses for early joiners, token incentives for suggesting new features or eventual bugs, higher security, and the list is long). \r\n\r\nThe team behind Veelancing now comprises 10 members, all of them crypto/tech/blockchain enthusiasts, working in different fields (IT, programming, cyber-security, financial, data analysis, business development, marketing, content creation, graphic design, etc) and managing to complement themselves as a whole. \r\n\r\nVeelancing is now in the Pre-ICO campaign and the ICO will follow shortly.", "dateAdded": "2021-04-01T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "35", "dateLaunched": "2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.1, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://veelancing.io"], "technical_doc": ["https://cloud.vbrinc.ro/index.php/s/Nj8syMDY6zXRNYF"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/veelancing"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/Veelancing"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/veelancing"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.20596070703804, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.35940442, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.24084746}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.19114339442229, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.69777669, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.65727245}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04648861272948, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.36404118, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.13881818}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34805398178444, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.39425772, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.32931142}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08875576355692, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.96926562, "priceChangePercentage7d": 24.34873985}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.33694404096231, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.74846408, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.91282617}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.61083613829526, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.8597277, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.30706896}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12824428571171, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.41160033, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.03728572}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04939216366166, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.77179605, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.43524148}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:32:07.047Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
