{"data": {"id": 328, "name": "Monero", "symbol": "XMR", "slug": "monero", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Monero (XMR)?\n\nMonero was launched in 2014, and its goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it\u2019s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person\u2019s identity, it\u2019s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.\n\nThe team behind Monero say privacy and security are their biggest priorities, with ease of use and efficiency coming second. It aims to provide protection to all users \u2014 irrespective of how technologically competent they are.\n\nOverall, XMR aims to allow payments to be made quickly and inexpensively without fear of censorship.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Monero?\n\nSeven developers were initially involved in creating Monero \u2014 five of whom decided to remain anonymous. There have been rumors that XMR was also invented by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto), the inventor of Bitcoin.\n\nXMR\u2019s origins can be traced back to Bytecoin, a privacy-focused and decentralized cryptocurrency that was launched in 2012. Two years later, a member of the Bitcointalk forum \u2014 only known as thankful_for_today \u2014 forked BCN\u2019s codebase, and Monero was born. They had suggested \u201ccontroversial changes\u201d to Bytecoin that others in the community disagreed with and decided to take matters into their own hands.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that hundreds of developers have contributed to XMR over the years.\n\n### What Makes Monero Unique?\n\nThere are several things that make Monero unique. One of the project\u2019s biggest aims is achieving the greatest level of decentralization possible, meaning that a user doesn\u2019t need to trust anyone else on the network.\n\nPrivacy is achieved through a few distinctive features. Whereas each Bitcoin in circulation has its own serial number, meaning that cryptocurrency usage can be monitored, XMR is completely fungible. By default, details about senders, recipients and the amount of crypto being transferred are obscured \u2014 and Monero advocates says this offers an upper hand over rival privacy coins such as Zcash, which are \u201cselectively transparent.\u201d\n\nObfuscation is achieved through the use of ring signatures. Here, past transaction outputs are picked from the blockchain and act as decoys, meaning that outside observers can\u2019t tell who signed it. If Ian was sending 200 XMR to Susan, this amount could also be split into random chunks to add a further level of difficulty.\n\nTo ensure that transactions cannot be linked to one another, stealth addresses are created for every single transaction that are only used once.\n\nAll of these distinctive features have led to XMR being increasingly used for illicit transactions instead of Bitcoin \u2014 especially on darknet markets. Governments around the world, especially the U.S., have also offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to anyone who can crack Monero\u2019s code.\n\n**Related Pages**:\n\n[Find out about Zcash, another privacy coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/)\n\n[All you need to know about the basics of crypto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics)\n\n[What is a ring signature?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ring-signature)\n\n[CoinMarketCap Blog: Interviews with top crypto influencers](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n### How Many Monero (XMR) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nMonero is slightly unusual as a token sale wasn\u2019t held for XMR \u2014 and no tokens were premined either. At the time of writing, the circulating supply of XMR stands at 17,703,471.\n\nThis cryptocurrency is designed to be resistant to application-specific integrated circuits, which are commonly used for mining new Bitcoin. In theory, this means that it can be possible to mine XMR using everyday computing equipment.\n\nOverall, there will eventually be a total of 18.4 million XMR in circulation \u2014 and this cap is expected to be reached on May 31, 2022. After this, miners will be incentivized using \u201ctail emissions,\u201d with a small amount of XMR being fed into the system every 60 seconds as a reward. It is believed this approach is more effective than relying on transaction fees.\n\n### How Is the Monero Network Secured?\n\nOne of Monero\u2019s main goals has to prevent centralization \u2014 and this network uses a consensus mechanism called CryptoNight, which is [based on](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-monero) proof-of-work. This prevents large mining farms from becoming a dominant force. \n\n### Where Can You Buy Monero (XMR)?\n\nBecause of its nature as a privacy coin, XMR isn\u2019t listed on some major exchanges. For example, although you can [buy XMR on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Monero), it isn\u2019t supported by Coinbase. As a result, you may need to convert your fiat into Bitcoin and go through a smaller trading platform. This guide[ helps explain](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) how you can convert fiat currencies into crypto with ease.", "dateAdded": "2014-05-21T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active",
