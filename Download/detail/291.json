It is a project that aims to decentralize the Internet. According to the developers, its concept predates Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) by several years.\n\nThe SAFE network works similarly to the TOR network, meaning that all online content is distributed and accessed through a peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) mesh network.\n\nMaidSafeCoin is a token for SafeCoin, a decentralized currency for the decentralized SAFE network, which is maintained by the users\u2019 extra hard disk space, processing power and data connectivity level.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of MaidSafeCoin?\n\nMaidSafeCoin was founded by David Irvine.\n\nIrvine was also the CEO of Ayrsoft Ltd, Alba Networks and worked as a consultant at Ayrshire Business Consulting Ltd.\n\n\n#### What Makes MaidSafeCoin Unique?\n\nMaidSafe offers fully encrypted data storage and file sharing, the ability to use the network anonymously, censorship-resistant communication, serverless data and a scalable cryptocurrency with zero transaction fees. \n\nThe SAFE Network was designed to be secure, fully autonomous, data-centric and peer-to-peer to work as an alternative to the current client-server model. The network is primarily used by two types of members: clients and farmers.\n\nThe clients use the features of the network, including browsing, storing data and transferring money, while the farmers store and maintain the data in exchange for a monetary reward. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about the [SandBox](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-sandbox/).\n\nLearn about [Arweave](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arweave/).\n\nLearn how to use CoinMarketCap on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-coinmarketcap).\n\nExpand your knowledge of cryptocurrencies with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many MaidSafeCoin (MAID) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nMaidSafeCoin (MAID) has a circulating supply of 452,552,412 coins, while maximum supply data is not available as of February 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the MaidSafeCoin Network Secured?\n\nThe SAFE network is an encrypted layer that is built on top of the current Internet and allows for autonomous data storage and networking by replacing three of the OSI networking layers.\n\nWhen you transfer a file to the network, such as a photo, it is broken down into pieces (shards), hashed and fully encrypted. This data is then randomly distributed across the network, and redundant copies of the data are created so that if someone storing parts of your file turns off their computer, you can still access it from somewhere else on the network.\n\nIn addition, due to the fact that no node on the network stores your file in its entirety, they cannot fully read it, adding an extra level of security. The network automatically creates extra copies of the data that\u2019s in high demand so that the more popular websites can be accessed from a larger number of nodes, further speeding up the system.\n\nSAFE\u2019s hash function is able to fully map any piece of data to 256-bit strings of characters, and the network can perform the XOR operation on the hash value in order to randomly create a unique distance to any other piece of data. This is not physical distance but a mathematical distance between two numbers. \n\nMaidSafeCoin is opposed to centralized storage, so it provides a solution in the form of vaults. The vault software can connect you to the SAFE network and save the distributed pieces of data on your computer. The people that run the vault software are known as farmers. You can voluntarily become a farmer by notifying the network, which then sends you a proof-of-resource request to check your bandwidth and CPU power.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy MaidSafeCoin
