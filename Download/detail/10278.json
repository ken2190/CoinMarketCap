{"data": {"id": 10278, "name": "Genshiro", "symbol": "GENS", "slug": "genshiro", "category": "token", "description": "## What is Genshiro (GENS)?\n\nGenshiro is Equilibrium's DeFi one-stop shop on Kusama that can do all things that existing DeFi primitives do, but with less risk and cross-chain.\n\nGENS is the native utility token that is used as:\n\n-   a reward for validators/collators running blockchain nodes and performing parallel work.\n\n-   a means to pay transaction/interest fees\n\n-   a means to pay transaction/interest fees\n\nbailout and collateral liquidity in Kusama-based liquidity pools (when the tokens obtain value)\n\n-   a governance token\n\n## How Many GENS Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total GENS supply on Kusama is 1.2 billion tokens. Let's see allocations below:\n\n45% Lockdrop to EQ holders\u00a0\n\n5% EQ staking bonus (additional rewards for those who participated in a\n\nlockdro)\n\n15% Liquidity farming\n\n20% Kusama IPO rewards\n\n15% Treasury (cover extreme losses in case of \"Black Swan\" events)\n\nDon't hesitate to check our GENS tokenomics: <https://genshiro.equilibrium.io/docs/genshiro-tokenomics.pdf>\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Genshiro?\n\nSince Genshiro is a canary network of Equilibrium, the founder and CEO is Alex Melikhov. Alex is an engineer in applied mathematics by training. Before blockchain, he was working on fintech projects.\n\nThe current team has been working together since 2017 building on Ethereum back in the day. In 2018, the team kicked off the development on EOS. In April 2019 the team launched the first decentralized EOS-based stablecoin as the first product of the Equilibrium's product line, called EOSDT. Today EOSDT is the most liquid decentralized stablecoin and the biggest DeFi project on EOS, with over $14 million of total value locked in our smart contracts, and over 1,000 user positions generated.\n\nNow the team is developing on Polkadot and Kusama to obtain true cross-chain interoperability and to turn Equilibrium and Genshiro into a full-fledged DeFi one-stop-shop.\n\n### Where Can I Buy GENS?\n\nGENS is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges:\n\n[Kucoin] (https://trade.kucoin.com/GENS-USDT)\n\n[DODOex] (https://app.dodoex.io/exchange/BUSD-GENS?network=bsc-mainnet)\n\n[BKEX] (https://www.bkex.com/trade/GENS_USDT)\n\n## What Is TrueUSD (TUSD)?\n\nTrueUSD is a U.S. dollar [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) pegged to USD at 1:1. First launched to a limited investor base in January 2018, TrueUSD has since grown to incorporate almost $400 million of backed tokens as of October 2020.\n\nTrueUSD is one of a number of cryptocurrency stablecoins administered by TrustToken, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets.\n\nAs with other stablecoins, TrueUSD aims to facilitate increased liquidity and provide cryptocurrency traders and general users with a nonvolatile asset relative to free-floating tokens such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC).\n\nAs of October 2020, TUSD is the 38th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of TrueUSD?\n\nTrueUSD is a stablecoin launched by parent company TrustToken, whose co-founder and CEO is Rafael Cosman.\n\nCosman has a lifelong attachment to cryptography, studying it along with artificial intelligence (AI) before working at both Google Brain and software company Palantir. He left Google to create TrustToken in 2017.\n\nCosman has stated that TrueUSD was always just the start of TrustToken's product line, involving relatively little work in return for creating a high-impact asset.\n\nAt the time of launch, he noted that regular auditing of the stablecoin formed an important focus for the company, giving investors peace of mind at a time when many cryptoassets were seeing heavy volatility in the wake of the initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) phenomenon.\n\n#### What Makes TrueUSD Unique?\n\nTrueUSD aims to balance stability and utility --- the main use cases of any stablecoin --- with security in the form of regular attestations.\n\nFrom its launch onwards, parent company TrustToken has sought to underscore the importance of independent verification of the stablecoin's provenance. As such, the stablecoin's appeal is geared towards larger investors looking to reduce risk, in addition to smaller private traders.\n\nTrustToken describes TUSD as \"the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar.\"\n\nTrueUSD is part of an ever-expanding stablecoin market, which now includes a large number of USD-backed assets. [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) remains by far the largest, with a market cap of $15 billion as of October 2020, compared to TUSD's $382 million.\n\nTrustToken has entered various corporate partnerships as part of its business activities, including options for TUSD holders to increase annualized passive income returns.\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about Tether [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/).\n\nLearn more about USD Coin [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/).\n\nNew to cryptocurrency? Find all the information you need with [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics), CoinMarketCap's dedicated education resource.\n\n#### How Many TrueUSD (TUSD) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere was around 381.9 million TUSD in circulation as of October 2020. Given its status as a stablecoin, the supply is uncapped, and will continue to expand according to demand.\n\nThere are two incarnations of TUSD available: an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and another, also known as TUSDB, a BEP-2 token on Binance Chain.\n\nTrueUSD's equivalent redeemability for USD is maintained via partnerships with banks and fiduciary entities.\n\n### How Is the TrueUSD Network Secured?\n\nTrustToken aims to deliver maximum transparency using tools such as real-time auditing of TUSD's backing and reliability.\n\nBeyond trusting the validity of its USD peg, any security issues relate to those which affect all ERC-20 standard tokens. Transactions, for example, can suffer from abnormally high fees if [gas prices](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) on the Ethereum blockchain spike.\n\n### Where Can You Buy TrueUSD (TUSD)?\n\nAs one of the largest USD stablecoins, TUSD is freely available on major exchanges, with pairs for cryptocurrencies and other stablecoins available.\n\nAmong the largest volume currently belongs to [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and DeFi automated market maker [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/).\n\nNew to crypto?
