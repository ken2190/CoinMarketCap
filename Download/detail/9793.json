{"data": {"id": 9793, "name": "FEED Token", "symbol": "FEED", "slug": "feed-token", "category": "token", "description": "Feed Token is a BSC charity-oriented token for a world matter cause.\r\nWe are going to work with recognized hunger organizations around the world to ensure our donations.\r\nOnce the market cap hits $1,000,000 donations will begin.\r\nEvery month, we will donate 10% of the tokens in the charity wallet to Organizations for stopping hunger from all over the world. Donations can be done in 1, 2, or 4 times a month. \r\n\r\nAbout our Mission\r\nThe intent of Feed Token is to stop world hunger, improve nutrition, and reduce food waste through a transparent and efficient system.\r\nDonations will certainly be received by thousands of people who need to improve their lives. We assure due diligence in the sense that your contribution is used for legitimate purposes, reaching its intended beneficiaries.\r\nWe are here to bridge the gap between those people most in need and those willing to lend a helping hand.\r\nHow are we planning to do this? Feed Token does it by means of using cryptocurrency. This allows us to acquire and transparently distribute donations through several recognized organizations that are looking for ways to alleviate world hunger.\r\n\r\nTokenomics\r\nOur contract is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain on address: 0xB1731E5e035CB039298159EcB191cB3fe666Dd0e\r\nName: FEED Token\r\nSymbol: $FEED\r\nThe tokenomics are as follows:\r\nTotal supply: 100,000,000 Feed tokens.\r\nPreSale: 35,000,000 Feed Tokens, with no vesting.\r\nPancake pool initial liquidity: 35,000,000 Feed tokens.\r\nAll LP tokens will be burned, locking away the seed liquidity for ever!\r\nAngel investors: 10,000,000 Feed Tokens vested over 10 months & 6 month initial lock-in period\r\nMarketing wallet: 10,000,000 Feed tokens vested over 7 months\r\nCharity wallet: 5,000,000 Feed tokens vested over 10 months\r\nTeam wallet: 4,000,000 Feed tokens vested over 8 months & 3 month initial lock-in period\r\nAirdrop: 1,000,000 Feed tokens.\r\n\r\nToken Features\r\nFEED Token is an auto-staking and auto-liquidity token, where all transactions obey the following mechanisms:\r\nReflection: 3% of every transaction will be redistributed to all FEED holders, in proportion to their wallet token balance, implementing auto-staking.\r\nThis means that the amount of tokens in your wallet will continuously increase as people transact. In effect, holders get rewarded for just holding FEED in their wallets. \r\nAuto-Locked Liquidity: 2% of every transaction is converted into FEED/BNB LP tokens, which contributes to the liquidity pool on Pancakeswap.\r\nThis relentlessly increases the liquidity pool, which leads to a permanently growing price floor of FEED.\r\nContract Ownership: The ownership has been renounced to the 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address upon creation\r\n\r\nThe Token Vault is a novel, secure smart contract on the blockchain with no functions! It is only used to store unvested tokens, which can be withdrawn by the Vesting smart contract.\r\nThe simplicity of the vault code means that it seems impossible to withdraw tokens from it by unauthorized/malicious actors, or even by the vesting beneficiary, before the vesting has matured.\r\nThe entire code for Token Vaults, and the Vesting smart contract have been audited, and no issues have been identified.\r\nThe vesting contract is deployed at: 0x94e3b4422E51bdC381fbada6511824387716f564", "dateAdded": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "",
