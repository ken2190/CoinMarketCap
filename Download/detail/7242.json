{"data": {"id": 7242, "name": "cVault.finance", "symbol": "CORE", "slug": "cvault-finance", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is cVault.finance (CORE)?\n\nCVault.finance is a [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) protocol with a deflationary governance token, CORE, that users can [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and use to [yield farm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming). The platform also plans to [introduce](https://help.cvault.finance/products/automated-strategy-vaults) \"Automated Strategy Vaults,\" which will allow for the automatic execution of profit-generating strategies for staked tokens.\n\nAiming to be completely decentralized, cVault.finance [calls](https://help.cvault.finance/faqs/governance) its governance model \"the strongest and most involved in DeFi.\" CORE token holders vote as a community to implement changes to the protocol, including the creation of new [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) or the elimination of existing ones.\n\nThe platform was [launched](https://twitter.com/CORE_Vault/status/1307391804535443462) on the Ethereum mainnet in September 2020, with CORE [debuting](https://twitter.com/CORE_Vault/status/1309913581186670592) on Uniswap seven days later.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of cVault.finance?\n\nCVault.finance was launched in September 2020 by two pseudonymous developers known as \"0xRevert\" and \"X 3.\" The two have a [history](https://0xdec4f.medium.com/the-idea-project-and-vision-of-core-vault-52f5eddfbfb) of working in traditional software development, but cVault.finance is their [first](https://t.me/InfinityGainzz/436599) crypto-related project. The co-founders have stated that they decided to create the platform after [witnessing](https://t.me/COREVault/43337) DeFi yield farming operations \"fantastically implode due to poor economic decisions\" such as minting new tokens as part of the farming process.\n\nIn October 2020, cVault.finance [brought on](https://t.me/coredevteam/25) another pseudonymous individual, \"0xdec4f,\" to join its leadership team as head of operations. Prior to assuming an official role with cVault.finance, 0xdec4f was an active community member and moderator of the platform's Telegram channel.\n\n\n### What Makes cVault.finance Unique?\n\nThe main way in which cVault.finance seeks to differentiate itself from other DeFi protocols is through its focus on deflationary yield farming. The project believes that minting new tokens to reward [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider) \u2014 a process carried out by many DeFi protocols \u2014 is unsustainable in the long term, as it devalues the token. It has [referred to](https://0xdec4f.medium.com/5-things-you-did-not-know-about-core-4bfe3d8b1452) this form of incentivization as \"flawed and short minded.\"\n\nCVault.finance offers what it [calls](https://medium.com/@CORE_Vault/introducing-core-fef3e1b77d12) \"deflationary farming\" in which no new tokens are ever minted. Rather, a 1% fee is charged on token transfers, and the fees are used to reward liquidity providers. In addition, the protocol prevents the withdrawal of [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) from Uniswap, which it says guarantees a stable market. These built-in measures, it argues, will ensure the sustainability of the platform.\n\nThe cVault.finance development team receives 7% of token transfer fees, while the remaining 93% is redistributed as rewards to liquidity providers.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn more about [UNI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/), the governance token of the Uniswap platform.\n\nLearn about [yearn.finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/), a DeFi project that skyrocketed in popularity in 2020.\n\nInterested in using Uniswap yourself? Read an [in-depth guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on DeFi, yield farming and more with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n### How Many cVault.finance (CORE) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nCVault.finance has a fixed supply of 10,000 tokens. All 10,000 CORE was minted in September 2020 during the project's initial seven-day \"liquidity generation event,\" or LGE, during which participants [contributed](https://twitter.com/CORE_Vault/status/1317930201725214720) over 3,759 [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) \u2014 valued at $1.41 million at the time \u2014 that was used to [create](https://help.cvault.finance/products/lge) a CORE/ETH Uniswap liquidity pool, with contributors receiving liquidity pool tokens. A second LGE was [held](https://medium.com/core-vault/lge-2-final-day-what-happens-next-c4f276b164cc) in October 2020, this time accepting [Wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/) (WBTC) and receiving over $5 million in value. The project plans to hold a third event centered around a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin).\n\nUnlike typical Uniswap pairs, these LP tokens cannot be redeemed for their underlying asset, thus permanently locking liquidity into the protocol. This has led to the creation of a secondary market where users [trade](https://medium.com/core-vault/empowering-a-true-defi-economy-with-bitcoin-97981359d69a) LP tokens for other assets. The development team of cVault.finance has also stated that this results in a so-called \"price floor,\" meaning that CORE can never drop below a certain price.\n\nAccording to cVault.finance, the development team [does not](https://twitter.com/CORE_Vault/status/1306827096006758402) receive any CORE tokens as a part of its LGEs.\n\n\n### How Is the cVault.finance Network Secured?\n\nCORE is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token \u2014 although it has [proposed](https://medium.com/core-vault/erc95-a-new-standard-e59e806b7d82) a new ERC-95 standard \u2014 meaning that it relies on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) to validate CORE transactions. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nAccording to co-founder X 3, because cVault.finance's liquidity generation events use open-source [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and liquidity is permanently locked in Uniswap, there is [no way](https://t.me/COREVault/71) for the developers to carry out a \"rug-pulling\" event in which the development team makes off with users' funds \u2014 thus making it more secure than other DeFi projects.\n\nThe project's smart contract was [audited](https://arcadiamgroup.com/audits/CoreFinal.pdf) in October 2020 by blockchain software development and security consulting company The Arcadia Group. The firm found that while there were no critical security flaws that required immediate attention, there were some fixes that could be implemented to improve security.\n\nThe cVault.finance team also [announced](https://twitter.com/CORE_Vault/status/1317248029716631552) in October 2020 that it was offering a $50,000 bug bounty for community members who find flaws in its upcoming changes to its code.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy cVault.finance (CORE)?\n\nCORE is primarily exchanged on [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), although it is also listed on Bilaxy and Hotbit. It can be traded against [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum), [WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/weth/) (WETH), [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether) (USDT) and [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC).\n\nAre you interested in buying CORE or other [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) such as BTC?
