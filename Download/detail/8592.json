Our structure ensures no one person has overwhelming control whilst giving us the fluid autonomy to be able to support those who need our help globally.\r\n\r\nOur aim is simple \u2013 to support the many public service workers, internationally, who face ever greater financial uncertainty by enabling access to cutting edge, tailor made, decentralised, financial tools.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to ensure that even in the face of unprecedented social, environmental and economic change, we continue to adapt and deliver innovative solutions that protect the interests of public service workers.\r\n\r\nHealthcare, education, the armed forces, fire services, security services and other public service workers are often under-rewarded and typically face great uncertainty at retirement. We are empowering everyone to participate in the creation of a brighter and more sustainable future for those that society relies on most.\r\n\u200b\r\nWherever the collective journey of humanity takes us in the coming years, we promise we\u2019ll continue to evolve to meet the needs of those who can most ensure our survival.\r\nDecentralised Finance\r\nThrough the use of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, we are providing a next generation \u201cDeFi\u201d service (Decentralised Finance) that offers exciting new ways for us all to take personal responsibility for giving back to public service workers and alternative avenues for those workers to direct their own financial destinies.\r\n \r\nSimplicity is one of the main driving forces for our whole team as we know that our ability to harness efficiency and our ability to share our vision depends on it. While technology can often be highly complex, we understand that with careful attention to detail, no challenge is out of reach or beyond our ability to distil into simple concepts and language.", "dateAdded": "2021-02-25T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "13", "dateLaunched": "2019-05-01T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.givingtoservices.com/"], "technical_doc": ["https://www.givingtoservices.com/whitepaper"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0x9cec686ba6f07d6135b2091140c795166ef5b761"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/svcscommunity"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/SVCSToken"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.21356672108635, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.95855789, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.25780336}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.19525149091612, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.16343854, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.81102233}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04647594642417, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.67128092, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.11950625}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.3445933676189, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.7671529, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.02682465}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08933243867596, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.03883388, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.23742777}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34491286064716, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.48938733, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.14705257}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.58967922291401, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.54296389, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.21669204}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12832738754273, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.47824973, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.02483051}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05168326672731, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.04058774, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.92156532}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:28:49.614Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
