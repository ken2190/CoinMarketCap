{"data": {"id": 8495, "name": "Everest", "symbol": "ID", "slug": "everest", "category": "token", "description": "## When Will Everest Cryptocurrency Trading Begin?\n\n[Everest](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/everest/) (ID) is a blockchain company that aims to bring economic inclusion and remove barriers to public services. It claims to be the world\u2019s only device-free, global digital transaction protocol with in-built identity \u2013 using digital identities on blockchain, electronic wallets, document management and biometrics. Its inception will bring blockchain and biometrics to governments, banks, exchanges, hospitals, NGOs and more.\n\nThey received a Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) license from the Maltese Financial Services Authority (MFSA), which allows Everest to operate as a regulated custodian for users. Everest\u2019s CRDT token allows businesses and users to program fiat currencies for various use-cases, facilitating value transfer across fiat currency and financial rails worldwide.\n\nEverest\u2019s platform consists of the following features: EverID \u2013 verifiable identity which is user-controlled, pseudo-anonymous and supported by the [Identity Network Foundation](https://identitynetwork.io/), a non-profit DAO; EverWallet \u2013 device-free account which stores multi-currency and biometric data; EverChain \u2013 the platform layer 2 ledger based on Ethereum; CRDT \u2013 pegged stablecoin for value storage (1 CRDT = USD$0.01); VFA \u2013 regulatory license to operate in accordance to laws; ID token \u2013 utility token enabling access to the identity network and exchange of value.  \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Everest?\n\nEverest was founded in May 2016 with the belief that without the fundamental elements of human exchange (value transfer), the economies of crypto and blockchain will not be able to grow. \n\nBob Reid is the co-founder and CEO of Everest. He received a BA in Political Science from the University of California, San Diego and an M.B.A. from Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. He has extensive experience in business development, was the General Manager of Licensing at BitTorrent, and VP of Strategy & Business Development at Neulion and DivX. Most recently, Bob was an advisor to Kai Labs, a blockchain-focused think tank & accelerator.\n\nBradley Witteman is the co-founder and CTO of Everest. He received a BA, M.B.A. and MA from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. He has almost 20 years of product management experience across various industries. Bradley was Senior Director of Product Management at BitTorrent, Chief Product Officer and founder of Moby Corp.\n\n\n## Can Everest Hit $1?\n\nEverest is a next-generation blockchain platform that is projected to unite the end-user market and financial institutions into the DeFi, crypto and fiat future. Everest full vertical stack consists of a gateway node, which enables partners to quickly integrate Everest to their legacy platforms using their APIs. Everest also enables integrated [KYC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc)/[AML](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/anti-money-laundering) on their platform through quick and inexpensive biometric ID. This combination of secure, mass-market biometrics and encryption allows Everest to complete identity creation and verification, compared to days needed by traditional financial institutions.\n\nEverest\u2019s compliance with regulatory requirements and ability to operate in legal jurisdictions is another major advantage. It\u2019s patent-pending biometric identity, virtual onboarding and account creation, cross-border transfers are vertically integrated to meet the needs of financial institutions. Everest is bridging the DeFi world with the regulatory requirements of governments. With its VFA license, Everest is allowed to issue its own stablecoin and process payments of \u201cprogrammable money\u201d in most jurisdictions with a merchant account. Everest also complies with Europe\u2019s GDPR and California\u2019s CCPA data privacy law.\n\nEverest has a vast number of partners and recognitions, including: Visa Everywhere Initiative 2020 \u2013 semi-finalist in two categories; Visa Fast Track 2020; Ethereum Foundation 2019 grant winner (eKYC); Inclusive FinTech 50 2019 winner; Oregon Enterprise Blockchain Venture Studio 2019 winner; New America, Blockchain Impact Ledger 2019; approved vendor list of United Nations and Asian Development Bank.\n\nIn July 2021, Everest partnered with Oracle Financial Services, a unit of Oracle Corp, with the aim of enhancing the bank's product offering across the world. Oracle is a software service utilized in retail and corporate banking and insurance services. This corporation will enable the verification of user\u2019s credentials. Thus, it will provide a diverse scheme of mitigating money laundering activities as it will allow banks to scrutinize cryptocurrencies, cross-border and decentralized finance. Everest Chief Executive and co-founder Bob Reid says that their blockchain-based identity and verification is projected to enhance banking and financial software.\n\n\n## Related Pages\n\nRead about [ERC-20 tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-erc-20-tokens-find-out-now-as-the-decentralized-finance-industry-takes-off).\n\nRead about [Cryptocurrency Money Laundering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cryptocurrency-money-laundering) and [KYC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc).\n\nLearn more about [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/should-i-invest-in-defi).\n\nWhat is web 3.0?

Receiving payments is free on the Everest system, but users need to stake 1-100 IDs in their wallet to send payments. For larger users which require greater levels of data, complexity, visibility and targeting, higher amounts of ID tokens need to be staked (up to 250,000). For institutions, the amount of IDs staked depends on a tiered level of access and specific market use-case.\n\nThe total supply is capped at 800,000,000 ID. The distribution of tokens is as follows: 19% to strategic partners, advisors and consultants; 19% to team; 38% for staking and rewards; 12% to ecosystem development; 12% to reserves.\n\nID tokens are bought and held by stakers (users, custodians, financial institutions, businesses and more) and eAgents (Kyber, Aave), which grants them access to the network for a limited period of time. eAgents are staking partners who manage eTellers, who earn ID tokens by signing users up to Everest services. Holding and staking ID will give users lower transactions fees and additional rewards.\n\n\n## How Is the Everest Network Secured?\n\nEverest (ID) is a cryptocurrency token built on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), and a smart contract is a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain and is supported by the platform. [Smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) allow the conclusion of trust relationships, transactions, and agreements between anonymous parties. This makes these processes transparent, secure, irreversible, and everything else can still be tracked.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Everest (ID)?\n\nEverest (ID) is listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges, it cannot be bought directly for fiat money, but coins can be obtained by buying Bitcoin on any of the fiat currency exchangers for cryptocurrency, and then transferring it to the exchange where the ID token is presented. Among them: [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), [Bitfinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/), [SushiSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/sushiswap/), [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/), [1inch Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/1inch-exchange/), [Kyber Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kyber-network/), [Bamboo Relay](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bamboo-relay/) and [KyberDMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kyberdmm/).\n\nCryptocurrency newbie?
