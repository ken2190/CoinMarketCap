{"data": {"id": 10595, "name": "Glitchy", "symbol": "GLITCHY", "slug": "glitchy", "category": "token", "description": "Glitchy is a community token which was community launched back on May 16, 2021. \r\nThe token was created on the Binance Smart Chain, where buyers & sellers get taxed on each transaction, which profits all Glitchy holders. A part of the tax goes toward increasing liquidity, and another part gets reflected to all holders. A percentage of this also goes to the maintenance wallet, which well help grow the project via marketing and development, while another percentage gets sent to the contract BNB balance. The BNB balance gets distributed to all holders weekly!\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Glitchy Unique?\r\n\r\nGlitchy has it's own App to do the BNB reward process which can be opened in Dapps.\r\n\r\nOwnership is required in order for the contract to work. The owner can start and stop the claims cycles. No minting functions exist in the contract. The Glitchy total supply can therefore only go down from now on and the owner can't create any more tokens. \r\n\r\nGlitchy aims to balance stability and utility \u2013 We aim to strengthen our reward system and identify areas for improvement to benefit our holders. We also plan to formulate exchange and token tracker in to directly buy Glitchy or BSC tokens in the future with just the use of our credit/debit cards. We will also be looking towards acquiring a position on several larger volume exchanges (i.e., kucoin, bittrex, hotbit). \r\n\r\nHow Many Glitchy Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nOn its launch, Glitchy produced 1 Quadrillion tokens. 80% of the supply was added to PancakeSwap against 0.5 BNB, 10% were burned and 10% remained on the deployer's wallet.\r\n      \r\nOf the deployed wallet holdings, 15% is now burnt. \r\n\r\nWhere Can I Buy Glitchy (Glitchy)?\r\n\r\nGlitchy can be bought using the Binance Smart Chain via Pancakeswap V2 Defi with 12-15% Slippage.\r\n\r\n[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) offers the largest number of pairs as of October 2020, while [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) also offers [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC), [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) and [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) options.\r\n\r\nNew to cryptocurrency?
