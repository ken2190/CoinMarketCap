Probably won't be like it for a long time. Because it has the support of PraeLegal.( PraeLegal provides its clients to access global legal resources through its vast network of well-established 252  offices in trade centers in 142 countries. It has more than 5,000 lawyers in its network worldwide.) PraeGold is a major investor and partner.\nEscoinToken was born out of an international need. It's a good idea to match lawyers and clients on a more productive basis.\nThe purpose of Escoin includes providing clients and law firms establish mutual cooperation in the digital environment in accordance with common interests by eliminating the country\u2019s borders and providing the entire infrastructure they need. In doing so, the aim is to expand the network and thus to provide a more transparent and healthy business model.\n \nAlso;\n* Finding the right lawyer for the right company,\n* Ensuring that all types of documents required by lawyers reach the inventory, quickly and easily,\n* Eliminating interruptions in payments made in international transfers,\n* Minimizing the loss of money during the exchange, to provide consultancy services without intermediaries in the international platform.\n* To make them feel that they are safe for companies and law firms, to make them feel their own and to be part of the network they can do international business without expenses such as office rent, office dues, secretary's salary, kitchen costs.\n* Making companies a part of the network, that they do not encounter with such questions as, \u201dIs there enough competence?\u201c, \u201cDo they have enough experiences?\u201c, \u201dI wonder if the cost is too high?\u201c.\n* 252 offices in 142 countries will be made exchange offices for EscoinToken (like a bank)\n* With the app that brings together the lawyer and the client, which is under construction, it will be ensured that the parties get maximum efficiency and finalize with minimum cost.\n* An agreement was reached with companies that are leaders in marketing.\n \n \nThe Escoin brand is owned by FinCras&InvCras Digital Services O\u00dc with the license and trademark registration obtained from Estonia in 2018. Our company's license has been obtained permanently with long-term and various periodic inspections.\n \n* Activity license FVR000244\n      \tCategory : Financial services Providing services of exchanging a virtual currency against a fiat currency\n       \tValid since : 28.06.2018\n*Activity license FRK000202\n       \tCategory : Financial services Providing a virtual currency wallet service\n       \tValid since : 28.06.2018\nAll EscoinTokens sent to circulation are entered under control and supervision in accordance with Estonian laws. All our processing is legal.\n \nWhy EsCoin?\nEcosystem in 6 steps: The main difference that distinguishes EsCoin from other ICO projects is that there is no other example in the world that combines the legal sector with firms in this sense!\nA-Experience; Guaranteed growth with the experience of one of the largest legal networks in the world with PraeLegal. Thanks to the support of PraeLegal in this system, our work area will increase rapidly in many countries of the world.\nB-Unique; Even though there are similar formations in the world, there is no such a transparent and lucrative one. What profit is here! No brokers here! There is diversity here! There is confidence here! Here\u2019s the quickest solution!\nC-Licensed; Before the ICO started to collect funds, cripto money, wallet and excange languages from Estonia were accuiared as EsCoin company. This can be considered as a proof of the continuity of Escoin.\nD-Own Stock Exchange; Escoin can be traded in many different geographies and in many different stock exchanges, as well as its own Escoin Exchange platform will be build. Escoin crypto will add value to money.\nE-Post-Free; There will never be any money transfer from the lawyers! One of the biggest problems faced by international law firms is bank transfer costs up to 25%.\nF-Own Money; Thanks to the continuity and uniqueness of the project, Escoin, which will produce its own crypto money, will appreciate the value it will gain over time and the Escoins which held by users will goin profit as well.\n \n## How Many EscoinToken Are There in Circulation?\nA total of 250 million units were produced in January 2019. A total of 170 million pieces of this production are planned to be incinerated (10 million pieces burned on 15/07/2021). Burning dates will be announced 15 days before. A total of 80 million copies will be sent to circulation (Advertisement & Marketing, Partners & Consultants, Software, Staff). So far, 35,352,392.58 ELG units have been sent into circulation. All EscoinTokens sent to circulation are entered under control and supervision in accordance with Estonian laws. All our processing is legal.\n\n### Where Can I Buy EscoinToken (ELG)?\nEscoin Token (ELG) [Finexbox](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/finexbox/),
