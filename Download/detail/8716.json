{"data": {"id": 8716, "name": "Convergence", "symbol": "CONV", "slug": "convergence", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Convergence (CONV)?\n\nConvergence is a new age protocol allowing both retail and enterprise users to swap between real-world assets and blockchain-based [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) utility tokens seamlessly. Set to officially launch around Mar. 25, Convergence aims to be the go-to decentralized interchangeable assets protocol.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Convergence](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-convergence).\n\nSupported by institutional investors like Divergence Ventures and Kinetic, Convergence has attracted a lot of attention. By building a bridge between real assets and the DeFi world, the protocol addresses a wide range of implementation issues standing before enterprise adoption of blockchain-based tokens. Aiming to be the first decentralized asset swap protocol, Convergence is one of the ICOs coming up in March 2021. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Convergence?\n\n[Oscar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-yeung/) and [Ivan Yeung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-yeungtt/) are the co-founders of Convergence. Oscar Yeung graduated with a degree in finance and international business from NYU Stern and immediately started a career in finance. In 2014, he took a position as a global markets analyst at Deutsche Bank. In 2016, Oscar Yeung founded KidHop, an educational platform banking on technological advancements to bring ease of use to parents looking for various activities for their kids. In 2021, Oscar teamed up with Ivan Yeung to found Convergence.\n\nIvan Yeung is the other half of the co-founding duo behind Convergence. He graduated with a degree in computer science from Simon Fraser University. In 2016, he became an information technology analyst for IBM and spent two years with the tech giant. In 2018, Ivan Yeung joined Axon Driver Solutions as a product development lead. Later on, in 2019, he joined Liquefy as a senior product manager. Since the beginning of 2021, Ivan Yeung has been actively working on Convergence and the protocol launch.\n\n\n#### What Makes Convergence Unique?\n\nConvergence is reportedly the first protocol to successfully create a bridge between real assets and tokenization. Convergence aims to merge the worlds of decentralized finance and traditional asset supply chains by providing organic liquidity to real assets. \n\nBy focusing on creating bridges between utility tokens and wrapped security tokens, Convergence aims to completely revolutionize how decentralized finance may function. Such bridges allow for more global adoption of DeFi technology by both private and enterprise users. Not only that, tokenizing real assets allows for greater liquidity, which is currently unavailable for certain asset classes. Convergence aims to bring the global financial system to the 21st century by relying on blockchain technology, tokenization and the versatility of decentralized finance. In essence, the Convergence protocol would allow users to easily swap between different types of assets, for example, a stock and a cryptocurrency. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Ren](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ren/).\n\nFind out more about [Algorand](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/algorand/).\n\nLearn more about [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-access-dapps-on-your-mobile-phone).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Convergence (CONV) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nConvergence has a total supply of 10,000,000,000 CONV tokens. The upcoming ICO will feature about 60,000,000 CONV tokens, or about 0.6% of the total supply, released for public sale. Convergence (CONV) currently has a circulating token supply of 448,000,000 tokens. \n\nOut of the total token supply, about 40% will go directly into the Convergence ecosystem. Another 10% will be distributed among prominent members of the Convergence community. About 20% of CONV tokens will be dedicated to strategic sales and liquidity guarantees. The founding team and advisors will receive 10% and 5% of the total token supply, respectively. Last but not least, 4% of the total supply has been distributed among investors during the seed sale for Convergence.\n\n\n### How Is the Convergence Network Secured?\n\nAs an [Ethereum-based](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) protocol, Convergence is secured by the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. While other popular consensus mechanisms like the one utilized by the Bitcoin blockchain, proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)), the PoS consensus is more scalable and eco-friendly. Unlike PoW, which requires large amounts of computing and electrical power, PoS relies on stakeholders to validate new blocks.\n\nConvergence also introduces EVM-compatibility, which allows it to interact with other chains (i.e., Binance Smart Chain, Moonbeam and more). The protocol also introduces the Convergence Automated Market Maker, which enables trading Wrapped Security Tokens and real asset price discovery at all times.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Convergence (CONV)?\n\nConvergence is still not a publicly-traded token, which is why it is not currently available for purchase. However, because this is an Ethereum-based token, aiming to revolutionize the world of asset trading completely, most big exchanges like [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/) are expected to start offering CONV tokens. \n\n[Find more information here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about buying
