While Vacay started in Europe, Vacay\u2019s vision is not limited by a map or geography. Vacay plans to expand into the United States and Asia-Pacific in the near-term.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Vacay Unique?\r\n\r\nThe main principle and goal of Vacay is to make cryptocurrency payments a mainstream option for international travelers as commercial airliners are cleared for take-off and the skies re-open following the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the accelerated proliferation and adaptation of cryptocurrencies, Vacay assesses the tourism, travel, and hospitality industry represents an untapped market within the broader decentralized finance (Defi) space. \r\n\r\nVacay aims to capitalize on the global tourism, travel, and hospitality industry, which is valued at approximately $9.25 trillion dollars, by leveraging the executive management team\u2019s extensive experience and network in the industry to form strategic partnerships with hotel chains, airlines, rental car services and renowned restaurants based in the European Union, United States, and the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\nHow Many Vacay Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe non-deflationary tokenomics of Vacay were designed to provide international travelers with a convenient method to pay for travel-related expenses on-the-go. The total supply of Vacay is approximately 1,000,000,000 tokens. Prior to the pre-sale, Vacay burned approximately 500,000,000 tokens or 50 percent of the total supply. There is a three percent tax associated with each sale, which is redistributed to the liquidity pool (LP).\r\n\r\nWho are the Founders of Vacay?\r\n\r\nPeter Mulder (CEO), Johan Bleeksma (CFO), and Bob Schulz (COO) are the founding members of the Vacay Project according to Vacay.Finance.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMr. Mulder has a PhD in Applied Science and Mathematics from The Hague University, over 30 years of experience in the travel, tourism, and hospitality industry, and is an avid investor in the cryptocurrency space. Mr. Mulder is also the owner and CEO of Peerkesbos Horeca Group, which owns and operates hotels, restaurants, and clubs located in the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Austria, Italy, France, and the Dutch Antilles.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMr. Schulz is a renowned investor in the travel and hospitality industry, an owner of several vacation properties across Europe, and maintains an extensive network with some of the largest hotel and car rental companies in the world.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMr. Bleeksma has over 20 years of experience and maintains an extensive network in the travel, tourism, and hospitality industry. Additionally, Mr. Bleeksma played professional tennis for the Dutch League, coached professional tennis in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Cote d'Azur.\r\n\r\nWhere Can I Buy Vacay?\r\n\r\nVacay
