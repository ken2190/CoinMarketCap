Xiasi Inu is creating an IDO platform named Xiasi Pad. This is a platform that will allow whitelisted addresses to swap BNB or BUSD for an allocation in projects (tokens) released on Xiasi Inu\u2019s platform. New tokens looking to launch on Xiasi Pad, will get exposure to thousands of new potential buyers to help raise awareness and liquidity. These tokens will also be distributed to those who stake $Xiasi for a period of time. In addition, those staking Xiasi will receive little cosmetics that they can equip to their own personal Xiasi. The greater the amount staked the more limited edition and unique the cosmetic will be (e.g., toys/clothing/treats/shelter). All tokens wanting to be listed have to go through a verification process in order to stop rug pulls and scammers on the platform. These tokens are able to provide a percentage of each transaction where it will go to a charity of their choice listed on the platform. Xiasi Inu is making a social influence with an initial focus on cancer charities in holland which will be listed first on the IDO platform.\r\nOur main aim is to build a community through transparency and security. Xiasi accomplishes this by integrating an Anti-Pump-Dump-Exit whales\u2019 scheme where buyers are unable to purchase more than 0.2% of the total supply. This is to ensure that even if holders sell their tokens, it will not damage the market causing the price to plummet. \r\nXiasi Inu has an 8% tax on every transaction. 4% is distributed to holders, 4% is auto locked into the LP pool, increasing rewards for holders, and increasing the price floor over time.\r\nA charity wallet has been put in place which will help with future funding and a percentage will be allocated to a charity of the community\u2019s choice.\r\n\r\n- Listed on CoinGecko\r\n- Listing on LBank exchange, 21:00, 18th June 2021\r\n- Listing on Hotbit exchange, 21st June 2021\r\n\r\nWhere to buy Xiasi Inu ($Xiasi)\r\n1) $XIASI Inu token is available on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain.
