Each DApp built includes a \"Blackhole\" burn feature decreasing the amount of T2X in circulation. This acts as a measure to help counter the inflation of auction lobbies each day.\r\n\r\nSince opening the platform in July of 2020 the team has proven its dedicated & track record by showing no signs of slowing down. Paving out a roadmap that includes a Profit Sharing DEX, PVP Smart Contract Games, and DeFi DApps.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-29T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "7", "dateLaunched": "2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://t2xtoken.io"], "technical_doc": ["https://t2xtoken.io/litepaper.pdf"], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://tronscan.org/#/token20/THsSSczBw9RRMJWYL5j2MtcgaPasL2xPGP/code"], "message_board": ["https://t2xtoken.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/t2xtoken", "https://t.me/t2xtoken"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/t2xtoken"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.91186752921941, "priceChangePercentage24h": 34.79177057, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.71962698}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.36960577973018, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.29293143, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.80735424}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.0459154546492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.8379693, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.59631629}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36217183431754, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.38713656, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.0655546}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08825297302251, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.52298553, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.10265883}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34948277408693, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.0744453, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.19608689}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.84617771491492, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.4837804, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.38743017}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884223796591, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.22962228, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.74739738}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05344197854214, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32002778, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.49536142}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:50:04.008Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
