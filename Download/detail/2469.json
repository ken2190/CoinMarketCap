{"data": {"id": 2469, "name": "Zilliqa", "symbol": "ZIL", "slug": "zilliqa", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Zilliqa (ZIL)?\n\nZilliqa is a public, permissionless [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps), and as of October 2020, it also allows for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming).\n\nDevelopment work officially started on Zilliqa in June 2017, and its testnet [went live](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-testnet-v1-0-release-codename-red-prawn-27974ca46ecb) in March 2018. A little over a year later, in June 2019, the platform [launched](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-mainnet-the-launch-and-beyond-4cd7e113369f) its mainnet.\n\nThe native utility token of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Zilliqa?\n\nZilliqa was first conceived by Prateek Saxena, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore School of Computing. Saxena and several students in the School of Computing published a paper in 2016 that outlined how a sharding-focused blockchain could improve network efficiency and speed.\n\nAround the same time, Saxena co-founded Anquan Capital alongside Max Kantelia, a lifelong finance and tech entrepreneur, and Juzar Motiwalla, former president of the Singapore Computer Society. The company incorporated Zilliqa Research in June 2017 to develop the Zilliqa network, bringing on Dong Xinshu as its CEO, Yaoqi Jia as its chief technology officer and Amrit Kumar as its chief scientific officer. All three previously worked as research fellows at the NUS School of Computing.\n\n\n#### What Makes Zilliqa Unique?\n\nZilliqa [claims](https://www.zilliqa.com/platform) to be the world's first public blockchain to rely entirely on a sharded network. This allows it to achieve high throughput and a high rate of transactions per second, which it says solves the scalability issue. Because each shard processes transactions individually, as the network grows and the number of shards increases, the number of transactions that can be processed per second also increases. As well, records are immediately added to the Zilliqa blockchain after being processed, meaning that no additional time for confirmation is required.\n\nZilliqa seeks to become the blockchain of choice for large-scale enterprise use, including among the advertising, gaming, entertainment and financial services and payments industries. In its 2018 position paper, its team [states](https://docs.zilliqa.com/positionpaper.pdf) that the platform \"aims to rival traditional centralized payment methods such as VISA and MasterCard.\"\n\nBoth Anquan Capital and Zilliqa Research, the company responsible for developing Zilliqa, hold significant reserves of ZIL.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn about the largest blockchain to consider incorporating sharding, [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\n\nLearn about [Harmony](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harmony/), another high-throughput, sharded blockchain project.\n\nWant to better understand crypto markets? Read CoinMarketCap's in-depth guide on [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics).\n\nStay up to date on the ins and outs of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Zilliqa (ZIL) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nZilliqa has a fixed maximum supply of 21 billion tokens. ZIL was first [made available](https://blog.zilliqa.com/more-details-on-zilliqas-token-generation-event-4e1b78e0cf5a) for sale as an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token as a part of a token generation event that concluded in January 2018. The tokens were subsequently transferred to the Zilliqa mainnet in a token-swap event that [concluded](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-successfully-wraps-up-token-swap-f8942e1ce743) in February 2020.\n\nBefore launching, Zilliqa generated 60% of all tokens (12.6 billion ZIL) to be distributed at the token generation event, and the remaining 40% (8.4 billion ZIL) will be created through the mining process. Ten percent of all tokens (2.1 billion ZIL) were reserved for Anquan Capital, 12% (2.52 billion ZIL) for Zilliqa Research, and 5% for contemporary and future Zilliqa team members \u2014 all of which were announced to be distributed quarterly over a three-year period.\n\nZilliqa is designed such that all tokens will be minted within 10 years, with the block mining reward slowly decreasing. According to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), the project [aims](https://docs.zilliqa.com/whitepaper.pdf) to have 80% of the tokens (16.8 billion ZIL) mined within the first four years and 20% (4.2 billion ZIL) in the remaining six years.\n\n\n### How Is the Zilliqa Network Secured?\n\nThe Zilliqa network is secured through a practical [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft), or pBFT, [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) protocol, meaning that at least two-thirds of all nodes must agree that a record is accurate in order for it to be added to the blockchain. Each Zilliqa blockchain shard relies on a group of nodes to confirm a subsection of all the transactions, and once each shard has reached a consensus, a second group of nodes confirms the shards' collective results and adds a new block to the blockchain.\n\nThe network uses elliptic-curve cryptography to secure its consensus protocol and allows for multisignatures. In addition to the pBFT consensus protocol that secures its transaction records, Zilliqa also uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) algorithm to assign node identities and generate shards.\n\nZilliqa [developed](https://www.zilliqa.com/language) a new language, Scilla, for its [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). Short for Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language, Scilla is a safety-focused language intended to automatically identify and eliminate security vulnerabilities at the language-level and make it easier to formally verify the safety of smart contracts through mathematical proofs.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Zilliqa (ZIL)?\n\nZilliqa's native token, ZIL, is listed on several major [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges \u2014 including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Bitfinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/) and Bithumb \u2014 where it is available to be traded against fiat currencies, [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAre you interested in buying ZIL or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC)?
