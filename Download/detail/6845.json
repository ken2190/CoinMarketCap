{"data": {"id": 6845, "name": "Subsocial", "symbol": "SUB", "slug": "subsocial", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Subsocial** **(SUB)?\n\nSubsocial is an open platform for creating decentralized social networks and marketplaces. Its main features are censorship resistance and built-in monetization methods. The platform allows users to create their own decentralized sustainable social networks and enjoy full control over them. Subsocial\u2019s developers describe it as a UI for decentralized communities.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Subsocial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-subsocial-will-monetize-decentralized-social-media-on-web-3-0).\n\nSubsocial has secured the support of the Web3 Foundation and the Polkadot/Kusama community. The team plans to integrate with Acala Network, Crust Network and OpenSquare in the near future.\n\nSubsocial began development in Q4 2019. The platform\u2019s main advantages include personalized feeds and notifications, IPFS integration, server rendering and full-text search.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Subsocial?\n\nAlex Siman is the founder and architect of Subsocial. Siman is also a Polkadot ambassador and the founder of DappForce, Substrate Ukraine and LearnWell Club.\n\nWhat Makes Subsocial (SUB) Unique?\n\nSubsocial is Polkadot's socio-financial protocol. It\u2019s an open platform built using the Substrate framework and the IPFS decentralized file system. It is censorship-resistant and has built-in monetization mechanisms. \n\nSubsocial is aiming to disrupt existing social media platforms by offering solutions to their endemic issues. These include global censorship, lack of customization, unfair monetization, inconvenience of use and monopoly on network effects.\n\nOne of the key features of Subsocial is the Serverless Public Timeline. Developers can run all web applications on IPFS, removing the need for centralized server hosts. Customizable moderation allows users to set rules for their space and ensures resistance to censorship. The platform offers built-in dynamic community management roles with detailed permissions.\n\nToken holders can participate in network governance via a control mechanism similar to that of Polkadot and Kusama.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/) and [Kusama](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kusama/).\n\nLearn more about [Acala](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-acala).\n\nFind out how Subsocial will monetize decentralized social media on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-subsocial-will-monetize-decentralized-social-media-on-web-3-0).\n\nLearn more about the world of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\nHow Many Subsocial** **(SUB) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of May 2021, the Subsocial platform is under development. The Subsocial Token (SUB) is required to execute transactions on the platform. SUB plays an integral part in Subsocial governance, allows users to pay for their actions and is used to reward validators.\n\nThe total supply of SUB tokens is allocated as follows: 20% to the team and advisors, 10-20% to the private sale, 20-30% to the public sale, 20% to the development grants, early adopters and marketing, and 20% to the Kusama parachain lease offering (PLO).\n\nHow Is the Subsocial Network Secured?\n\nSubsocial runs on Polkadot, which is responsible for providing a secure and scalable platform.\n\nShared security is Polkadot's key offering for [parachains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-parachains-2). All parachains that are connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain by leasing a parachain slot will benefit from the economic security that validators provide.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Subsocial** **(SUB)?\n\nAs of May 2021, Subsocial has entered the private sale stage, during which 860,000 SUB will be distributed. After the private sale is over, the public sale will follow in the form of an initial dex offering ([IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-dex-offering)).\n\nStay up-to-date with the CoinMarketCap [crypto calendar](https://coinmarketcap.com/events/).\n\nRead our step-by-step [guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) on how to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n", "dateAdded": "2020-09-02T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "643", "tags": [{"slug": "substrate", "name": "Substrate", "category": "PROPERTY"}, {"slug": "polkadot", "name": "Polkadot", "category": "PLATFORM"}, {"slug": "polkadot-ecosystem", "name": "Polkadot Ecosystem", "category": "PROPERTY"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://subsocial.network/#features"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": [], "source_code": ["https://github.com/dappforce/dappforce-subsocial"], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/dappforce"], "chat": ["https://t.me/Subsocial"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/DappForce"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.85772503734395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 40.30756529, "priceChangePercentage7d": 57.90745062}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.29499070066937, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.52326861, "priceChangePercentage7d": 21.67542856}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04647355788614, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.57682717, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.43140837}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.36656520586486, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.09072449, "priceChangePercentage7d": 27.22323593}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08980153241338, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.56349231, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.02438398}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.39082136530065, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.02278986, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.75426601}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.57970010316956, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.61993043, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.51452389}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12842553254554, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.43732251, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.71042985}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05648541496579, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.73343012, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.22292281}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:16:29.649Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "10", "credit_count": 0}}
