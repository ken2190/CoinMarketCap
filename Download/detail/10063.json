{"data": {"id": 10063, "name": "NFTBOX.fun", "symbol": "NFTBOX", "slug": "nftbox-fun", "category": "token", "description": "NFTBOX is a decentralized finance (DeFi) token. NFTBOX  has three functions that take place during each trade: Reflection, LP Acquisition and Burn.\r\nNFTBOX protocol is a combination of RFI tokenomics and an auto-liquidity generating protocol. \r\nNFTBOX launched on Mar. 17, 2021.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes NFTBOX Unique?\r\nThe NFTBOX notes that a big problem in the emerging DeFi industry is the existence of high APY LP-farms that dont have easy access for newcomers to the space.\r\nWith NFTBOX, they aim to use the idea of static rewards (making the reward conditional upon the volume of the token being traded) in order to remove any pressure on the token that could occur when tokens are sold. As well their \u201creflect mechanism\u201c adds incentive for NFTBOX holders to keep their tokens for longer, or HODL. NFTBOX Automatic LP also adds stability to the protocol by providing a price floor/cushion for token holders. NFTBOX manual burn strategy also helps NFTBOX token holders in the long term, according to their white paper.\r\n\r\nHow Many NFTBOX Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\nTotal supply of 100,000,000,000,000,000, with 99,000,000,000,000,000 burned dev tokens and a fair launch supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000,\r\nThe NFTBOX protocol works in the following way: in each trade, the transaction is taxed with a fee of 6%, which is cut in half. While 3% of the fee is redistributed to all of the token holders at the time, the other 3% is then split in half again, with 50% sold by the contract into BNB, and the remaining 50% automatically paired with the aforementioned BNB and added to PancakeSwap as a liquidity pair.\r\n\r\nHow Is the NFTBOX Network Secured?\r\nThe NFBOX white paper has the following plan for the safety of its protocol: the developer burned all tokens in the Dev Wallet before launch, there was a fair launch Pancake, the LP is locked on UniCrypt for 1 year, and an LP is generated with every trade and locked on PancakeSwap.\r\nWhere Can You Buy NFTBOX (NFTBOX)?\r\nAs of May 2021, you can purchase NFTBOX on PancakeSwap.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "",
