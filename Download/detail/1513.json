{"data": {"id": 1513, "name": "BitConnect", "symbol": "BCC", "slug": "bitconnect", "category": "coin", "description": "The FBI is currently seeking information from victims of the BitConnect ponzi scheme \u2014 if you believe you were a victim or participated in BitConnect, you can contact the FBI [here](https://www.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services/seeking-victim-information/seeking-victims-in-bitconnect-investigation).\n\nBitConnect is a ponzi scheme, or a fraudulent investment scam. \n\n\n## What Was the BitConnect (BCC) Ponzi Scheme?\n\nBitConnect (BCC) was an allegedly open source cryptocurrency and the native token of the now-defunct ponzi scheme BitConnect.\n\nLaunched in February 2016, shortly after the project itself, BCC aimed to function as the means by which participants in the BitConnect scheme invested and received payouts. \n\nIts tenure lasted almost two years, during which it hit all-time highs of $471 in December 2017, at the same time as Bitcoin\u2019s run to just under $20,000.\n\nThereafter, legal problems with BitConnect saw its organizers exit the scheme, leaving investors with nothing and the value of BCC at virtually zero, where it has remained ever since.\n\nAt its height, BitConnect\u2019s market cap was $2.5 billion, with estimates varying as to how much its founders gained when it shut down soon afterwards.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of the BitConnect Ponzi Scheme?\n\nAs with all ponzi schemes, the true identities of the founders of BitConnect and the developers of BCC remain shrouded in mystery. \n\nVarious figures associated with the scheme, including Indian citizens Satish Kumbhani, Mahendra Chaudhari and Divyesh Darji, have come to light as part of the legal fallout from BitConnect\u2019s demise.\n\nIn October 2020, another alleged promoter of BitConnect, this time Australian John Bigatton, was charged with offering unlicensed financial services and five other counts related to his involvement. Unrelated to the BitConnect charges, Bigatton\u2019s wife [disappeared](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8220205/Bitcoin-entrepreneur-husband-Madeline-Bigatton-faces-jail.html) several months after BitConnect collapsed.\n\nCarlos Matos, perhaps the best-known figure related to BitConnect, was not part of its development and merely engaged in PR activities on others\u2019 behalf. Matos has since stated he was unaware BitConnect was a ponzi scheme and that he also lost money \u2014 a total of $25,610 \u2014 as a result of investing in it.\n\n\n#### How Did the BitConnect Ponzi Scheme Work?\n\nBitConnect touted itself as a means of solving real-world financial problems using cryptocurrency and bypassing banks. \n\nBCC was a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) cryptocurrency token with a notional maximum supply of 28 million BCC. 2.6 million BCC were planned to come from mining, while the remainder would be added as a result of PoS staking activities from network participants.\n\nMaking use of the more altruistic arguments used by proponents of legitimate cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC), the scheme hooked millions of investors and built up a market cap which topped $2.5 billion in late 2017. \n\nIn reality, BitConnect\u2019s unique selling point did not exist, as under the hood, its foundation was that of any other pyramid scheme. An investor would provide Bitcoin on the premise that interest would be worth the trouble almost immediately, and earn dividends by signing other users up in addition to sky-high payouts.\n\nFrom a starting value of near zero, BCC reached highs of $471 in December 2017. Two months later, once the founders had all exited, the token was practically worthless once more. \n\nAt the time of its collapse in February 2018, BitConnect did achieve the dubious honor of being one of the largest cryptocurrency scams in history, rivalling only the likes of OneCoin and PlusToken in terms of illicit gains.\n\nAll \u201cofficial\u201d information about the token is no longer available, as BitConnect\u2019s website has long been offline.\n\n\n### Do Not Buy BitConnect (BCC)\n\nBCC is no longer tradable on any bonafide exchanges thanks to the founders\u2019 exit scam and ensuing legal difficulties.\n\nTo learn about Bitcoin and legitimate cryptocurrencies, check out CoinMarketCap\u2019s [easy guide to buying Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).", "dateAdded": "2017-01-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "inactive", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2018-09-27T19:25:29.000Z", "watchCount": "342", "tags": [{"slug": "mineable", "name": "Mineable", "category": "OTHER"}], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.bitconnect.co/", "https://bitconnectcoin.co/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": ["https://chainz.cryptoid.info/bcc/", "https://www.blockexperts.com/bcc"], "source_code": ["https://github.com/bitconnectcoin/"], "message_board": [], "chat": [], "announcement": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1681719.0"], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/bitconnect"]}, "volume": 0.0, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.25036852530474, "priceChangePercentage24h": 34.20809896, "priceChangePercentage7d": 54.13653891}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.07209851862907, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.98683814, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.16028357}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04617771613493, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.82436539, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6614586}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.39089624515086, "priceChangePercentage24h": 15.82705173, "priceChangePercentage7d": 27.8533897}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08717748639387, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.45441818, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.2204352}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3550350905629, "priceChangePercentage24h": 3.41643624, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.89586854}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.56294096569438, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.17987182, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.44705995}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12753593323946, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.28810494, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.48093056}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04477174602148, "priceChangePercentage24h": 1.26614134, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.8428627}], "relatedExchanges": [{"id": 319, "name": "AEX", "slug": "aex"}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T08:39:13.047Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "9", "credit_count": 0}}
