It offers users the ability to easily exchange in-game assets without any intermediaries. The developers, in turn, can attract new users and receive additional income from the sale of game items and tokens.\n\nMist launched in Q1 2021 and is built around NFTs, staking and farming. The Mist Universe and all its elements run on the BSC with the MIST token acting as the main in-game currency used to buy NFTs.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Mist?\n\nMist is a Binance Smart Chain-based action RPG that was created by anonymous developers. \n\nFrom the beginning of April 2021, Mist has partnered with Solid Group, KickPad, Solidity Finance, Vendetta Capital, DuckDAO, MANTRA DAO, AU21 Capital, JUN Capital, Exnetwork Capital and X21 Digital. \n\nThe team\u2019s key advisors include Timothea Horwell (Orion Protocol), Eric Su (Exnetwork Capital) and Garlam Won.\n\n\n#### What Makes Mist (MIST) Unique?\n\nThe game is based on the in-house gaming platform Mist NFT Game Framework (MNGF). MNGF is a created environment with five playable character classes and their various abilities. The NFTs in Mist are functional: they can be added to the Mist Game Framework and turned into game elements. They can also be traded in two ways: on in-game exchanges and on third-party NFT exchanges.\n\nThe main purpose of the MIST token is to buy and exchange NFTs both in the game and beyond. Participants can list their NFTs for sale and swap them for MIST tokens via in-game auction houses.\n\nThe native token can be staked outside of the Mist Universe. When someone places bets or uses MIST for farming, a reward is generated. The token runs on the Binance Smart Chain and is compatible with every wallet on the network.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [The Sandbox](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-sandbox/).\n\nRead about [Blockchain Cuties Universe Governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/blockchain-cuties-universe/).\n\nLearn more about NFTs with [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft).\n\nExpand your knowledge of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Mist (MIST) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nMIST is a cryptocurrency token based on the Binance blockchain with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens.

MIST can be securely stored on supported wallets that are connected to the Binance Smart Chain.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Mist (MIST)?\n\nAs of April 2021, MIST tokens can only be traded on the [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/) decentralized exchange.\n\nTo learn more, read our [dedicated guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) on how to buy
