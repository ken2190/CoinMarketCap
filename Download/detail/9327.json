{"data": {"id": 9327, "name": "SPUNGE", "symbol": "SPUNGE", "slug": "spunge", "category": "token", "description": "Spunge is a community driven and directed project, which adds value to the BSC space through incentives for hodlers and users, as well as charitable giving through a DAO-controlled treasury!\r\nKey features:\r\nSafemoon fork, with 5% liq tax and 3% redistribution tax.\r\nThe liquidity tax is crucial, as it will allow us to do buyback / burns similar to ITS but on a manual schedule (so no bots). This will create deflationary pressure on the token, while also giving the opportunity to add to the treasury funds regularly!\r\nNFTs & Lotteries\r\nMaking sure to take advantage of the latest DeFi NFT Hype, Spunge will be partnering and releasing Limited Edition NFTs. In addition, NFT & Token Lotteries will form a key part of the Day-to-Day and Weekly project events. There\u2019s a little Degen in all of us! NFTs will be purchasable for both BNB and SPUNGE\r\nDAO\r\nWe\u2019ve created a unique approach to a DAO, which will allow regular deposits into the treasury via methods such as NFT sales and liquidity fees! Allocations for these funds will be things such as charity, buyback and burns, token lotteries, NFT lotteries. This will be collaborated on in an exclusive telegram group accessible for holders of a certain number of tokens (to be determined). The launch of the DAO Telegram will be in a few days.\r\nCharity\r\nA core part of SPUNGE from its inception has been a commitment to philanthropy. We want to be able to use the platform we create to give back in a community-guided way. The community will be able to vote on charities to contribute to, and allocate funds. The first charity we have picked out of the gate is Charity:Water https://www.charitywater.org/about. Clean drinking water is the most important thing for sustaining life, and it only makes sense that a token named SPUNGE should do something water related", "dateAdded": "2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "184", "dateLaunched": "2021-03-31T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://www.spunge.space"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://medium.com/@spunge.space/spunge-61d9e73a9866"], "chat": ["https://t.me/codenamebob"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/SpungeSpace"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.39573307597338, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.99695168, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.65196276}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.13951826462414, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.41720606, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.23403521}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04642130446666, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47479612, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.76378252}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34543127132665, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.10634214, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.07975349}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08809375205785, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.47012283, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.20479819}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.3365804189963, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.72571723, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.81210172}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.61551425760311, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.84200543, "priceChangePercentage7d": 15.02118715}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12756201108951, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.48873139, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44700682}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04698230570444, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.32158169, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.92562492}], "relatedExchanges": [], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:34:04.075Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
