{"data": {"id": 9592, "name": "Fortress Lending", "symbol": "FTS", "slug": "fortress-lending", "category": "token", "description": "Fortress is an algorithmic money market, and synthetic stable coin protocol designed to bring secure and trustless credit and lending to users on Binance Smart Chain. \r\n\r\nFortress enables investors to lend and/or borrow cryptocurrencies, by pledging the platform an over-collateralized amount of cryptocurrency. Fortress does this by utilizing money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand of each asset. \r\n\r\nUsers who choose to supply liquidity to Fortress earn compounded interest as rewards for supplying their assets to the protocol. When supplying assets, users are also given the ability to mint stable-coins, or borrow other assets against their supplied assets. Once a user has supplied assets to Fortress, the user can then borrow assets or mint stable-coins, by over-collateralizing and paying interest on the amount borrowed. \r\n\r\nLoans from the Fortress protocol do not have monthly payments, late fees, and can be paid off at any time. Fortress is able to do this without ever requiring a credit check, with near-immediate origination, using smart contracts that provide an automated, and absolutely transparent system for investment and profit distribution.\r\n\r\nIn a future Fortress update, users will be able to spend FTS tokens to reduce the interest rate when borrowing, or increase the interest rate when supplying. This mechanism will greatly empower our users to fine tune their investments, to their own personal time-scales, by allowing the user to choose how much FTS they want to spend to modify their interest rate. An example of how this is done traditionally is when people choose to spend money to buy down the interest rate on their mortgage.\r\n\r\nFortress unites investors, borrowers, exchanges and others, into an open and fair platform, that empowers users and unlocks billions of dollars of value, corrects market inefficiencies, and offers tremendous potential to investors and users alike.",
