{"data": {"id": 10612, "name": "Sakhalin Husky", "symbol": "SAHU", "slug": "sakhalin-husky", "category": "token", "description": "$SAHU is an ERC-20 token minted with a supply of 1 quintillion. Initial supply had been reduced at the release of the token by 50% which has been burned to a dead wallet. The contract contains a tax percentage on the transacted quantities of $SAHU of 4%. This translates to <2% redistribution reward awarded to holders and >2% burn. \r\n\r\n$SAHU\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a use-case that will bestow the token with enduring value. \r\nTo that end, the $SAHU leadership team has identified a space for $SAHU in the emerging NFT marketplace. Even though NFTs have generated billions of dollars in revenues, listing non-fungible tokens (NFT)  for sale and making NFT purchases is still largely inaccessible to the general public. This is where $SAHU comes in. Our goal is to create a $SAHU NFT marketplace, where NFTs can be easily listed and sold on a $SAHU platform. $SAHU holders will be entitled to exclusive deals and discounts when making purchases using their $SAHU tokens.\r\n\r\n$SAHU respects all other existing tokens and coins in the crypto world. We as a community believe in continued growth and value friendly rivalries. We are not Dogecoin killers or Shiba Inu killers, but in a world which has been continuously let down by traditional currencies and investment opportunities, we believe there is room for all tokens to succeed and help grow the crypto technology landscape, each offering a variation of use cases.\r\n\r\n$SAHU respects all crypto holders, no matter what cryptocurrency is being held. We welcome all to be part of the community and together we will be able to build a great future for $SAHU.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-24T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-09T21:44:05.000Z", "watchCount": "298", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://sahufinance.com/"], "technical_doc": ["https://sahufinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Whitepaper-SAHU-v1.1..pdf"], "explorer": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0x2b1fe2cea92436e8c34b7c215af66aaa2932a8b2"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/SAHUofficialCommunityChat", "https://discord.com/invite/afXMW29Y2e"], "announcement": [], "reddit": ["https://reddit.com/r/SAHUFinance"], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/SAHUFinance"]}, "volume": 0.0, "volumeChangePercentage24h": 0.0, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1027, "contractAddress": "0x2b1fe2cea92436e8c34b7c215af66aaa2932a8b2", "contractPlatform": "Ethereum", "contractPlatformId": 1, "contractChainId": 1, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Ethereum", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://etherscan.io/token/0x2b1fe2cea92436e8c34b7c215af66aaa2932a8b2", "contractDecimals": 9, "platformCryptoId": 1027}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.92977068571834, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10039856, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.55954688}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.32092704825381, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.27214295, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.11024999}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04594882968113, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.93324584, "priceChangePercentage7d": 18.08688784}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35335416203082, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.01006705, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.31192844}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08804909629602, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32224677, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.60389594}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.357622264819, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.41626115, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.08194781}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.83378431858991, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.58354766, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.02039539}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12913193249675, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.62568219, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.61310133}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04965334281321, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.23301954, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.7174234}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9022, "name": "Trust Wallet", "tier": 1, "url": "https://www.trustwallet.com/", "chains": "ETH", "types": "app,trade", "introduction": "", "star": 2.0, "security": 3.0, "easyToUse": 3.0, "decentration": true, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000008, "logo": "9022.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:53:26.081Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "118", "credit_count": 0}}
