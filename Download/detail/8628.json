MEDIC is an online B2C marketplace where global citizens can access quality healthcare services for general well-being. Our approach to care is holistic at its core, focusing on the health of body, mind, and soul.\r\n\r\nChartchain - Secure and verifiable blockchain-based patient data storage model that eliminates privacy concerns. Chartchain unifies the patient data storage models in all affiliated hospitals and clinics.\r\n\r\nViCloud \u2013 Our exclusive software to connect existing IoTenabled medical devices on the market gives doctors access to real-time patient data via streaming. ViCloud is a powerful tool that not only provides convenience to healthcare providers but also collects a massive amount of data remotely, which will be stored securely in our Chartchain.\r\n\r\nSUJIN \u2013 AI-based virtual diagnostic assistant for healthcare providers. SUJIN will learn from the data stored on Chartchain to assist healthcare providers with their diagnostic process and help reduce human error. With SUJIN\u2019s prediction model of suspected diseases based on algorithmic thinking, healthcare providers will be able to reduce their risk of malpractice. Moreover, thanks to AI, SUJIN will be capable of processing quantities of data that would previously have been unthinkable, and its complex data analytics model lets it see data that a human might fail to observe.\r\n\r\nProject Eureka - The exclusive funding platform of MEDIC. We plan to use Project Eureka to discover and accelerate other unique projects out there with a vision to solve global problems. On top of our mission to provide wide-ranging access to quality healthcare, we hope to help others who are helping humanity through the growth of science and technology.", "dateAdded": "2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "37", "dateLaunched": "2020-11-15T00:00:00.000Z", "launchPrice": 0.0675, "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://medic.healthcare/"], "technical_doc": ["https://www.dropbox.com/s/l1apmc71vzcyxl9/MEDIC%20whitepaper%20V1.pdf?dl=0"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/token/0x9170e055e6037d3722dd01d04bdab1c56d2e746d"], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://medichealthcare.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/medicannouncement", "https://t.me/medic_public"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/2020_medic"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0x9170e055e6037d3722dd01d04bdab1c56d2e746d", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x9170e055e6037d3722dd01d04bdab1c56d2e746d", "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.21356672108635, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.95855789, "priceChangePercentage7d": 55.25780336}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.19525149091612, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.16343854, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.81102233}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04647594642417, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.67128092, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.11950625}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.3445933676189, "priceChangePercentage24h": 17.7671529, "priceChangePercentage7d": 26.02682465}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08933243867596, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.03883388, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.23742777}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.34491286064716, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.48938733, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.14705257}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.58967922291401, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.54296389, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.21669204}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12832738754273, "priceChangePercentage24h": 7.47824973, "priceChangePercentage7d": 13.02483051}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05168326672731, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.04058774, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.01418947}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:29:04.035Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "6", "credit_count": 0}}
