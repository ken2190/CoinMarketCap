{"data": {"id": 7095, "name": "Unisocks", "symbol": "SOCKS", "slug": "unisocks", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Unisocks (SOCKS)?\n\nUnisocks is an \u201cexperimental\u201d [non-fungible token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) (NFT) listed on the [Uniswap exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), which represents a real pair of limited edition and dynamically priced socks that users can purchase from anywhere in the world. Holders of $SOCKS can sell them through the Unisocks platform anytime they want. Furthermore, it can also be used to redeem the pair of socks that the token represents.\n\nUniswap warns that Unisocks is one of the [experimental projects](https://twitter.com/UniswapProtocol/status/1126511166916718592) on the protocol, which means that it\u2019s very risky to invest in. Anyone with an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) compliant token can purchase SOCKS. Every time a SOCKS is purchased, its value increases, which is what is referred to as the \u201cbonding curve\u201d model.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Unisocks?\n\nThe Unisocks project was launched by the Uniswap team, and first brought to the limelight during the Fluidity Summit in New York City on May 9, 2019. In keeping with the zany and envelope-pushing nature of DeFi in 2020, the Unisocks project may seem completely absurd at first glance and a game between [DeFi degens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi-degens). However the end goal of shifting the borders of DeFi applications is very serious indeed, much like the [MEME token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/degenerator-meme/) that transformed the world of art and NFTs last year did. \n\nSome of its known [developers](https://twitter.com/UniswapProtocol/status/1126506347673948161) are Noah Zinsmeister, Uniswap\u2019s engineering lead, and Callil Capuozzo, Uniswap\u2019s designlLead. Leander Capuozzo, Callil\u2019s brother who worked with Uniswap on the design of Unishirt for their V0 birthday, also helped out on the sock design.\n\nDean Eigenmann, a security researcher and co-founder of the blockchain governance startup Harbour and decentralized exchange platform Dexy, performed a quick review of the Unisocks platform before it was launched.\n\n\n#### What Makes Unisocks Unique?\n\nUnisocks is an experimental NFT project. Unlike other NFTs in the [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) space, $SOCKS follows a \u201c[bonding curve](https://www.linumlabs.com/articles/bonding-curves-the-what-why-and-shapes-behind-it)\u201d model governing its price, which enables the early adopters to earn more in profit than the late majorities. This is because when there are more tokens bought and brought to the supply, its value increases accordingly.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: the bonding curve model is facilitated by a [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), which is designed to function as an [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) with very specific purposes related to the [tokens in circulation](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/circulating-supply).\n\nFirst, the model allows for the initial minting and purchase of the token based on a price determined within the smart contract. Then, the supply of the token will dictate how the token will be valued later on. If the token supply increases, the price increases consequently.\n\nAll the assets used to purchase NFTs, which is $SOCKS, in this case, are kept in a different smart contract labeled as the \u201creserve pool.\u201d\n\nFinally, in $SOCKS, the corresponding NFT gets burned, which simply means that it is removed from circulation, as soon as it is redeemed for a real pair of socks.\n\n\n#### Related Pages\n\nLearn more about [Decentraland](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/).\n\nLearn more about [Rarible](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rarible/).\n\nRead more about [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token).\n\nCheck out the [CMC blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Unisocks (SOCKS) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere were about 500 SOCKS tokens created and locked into Uniswap\u2019s [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) with 35 ETH, which created this initial upwards price curve for SOCKS. \n\n\n\n<p id=\"gdcalert1\" ><span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href=\"#\">Back to top</a>)(<a href=\"#gdcalert2\">Next alert</a>)<br><span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\">>>>>> </span></p>\n\n\n![alt_text](images/image1.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n\nEvery SOCKS that are sold increases the cost of the next one, but conversely, they can be sold back into the pool anytime, where they will be burned for 1 real pair of unisocks and shipped to any destination in the world. \n\nAfter at least 100 days, all remaining liquidity will be removed and the SOCKS tokens that are left will be burned.\n\nSOCKS reached an all time high (ATH) price of over $12,000 on Jan. 19, 2021. Furthermore, it is designed to increase in value every time a token is purchased. At present, only 326 SOCKS are in circulation. \n\n\n### How Is the Unisocks Network Secured?\n\nUnisocks runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain, just like its parent platform, Uniswap. It follows the [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) token standard for Ethereum-based NFTs. This means that Unisocks\u2019 security rests on the second-largest blockchain network, Ethereum, which currently uses a [dual PoW and PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hybrid-pow-pos) consensus mechanism.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Unisocks ($SOCKS)?\n\nBuying $SOCKS is fairly easy. Users can just visit the Unisocks interface from the [Uniswap webpage](https://unisocks.exchange/) and connect it with their own [cryptocurrency wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/wallet). Afterwards, they can purchase as much $SOCKS as they want through their ERC-20 compatible tokens including ETH, [ANT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aragon/), [BAT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/), [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) and [KNC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kyber-network/).
