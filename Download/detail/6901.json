{"data": {"id": 6901, "name": "Swerve", "symbol": "SWRV", "slug": "swerve", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is Swerve (SWRV)?\n\nSwerve is a decentralized [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) exchange [pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) that was forked from [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/). Similar to Curve, it is primarily focused on [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) pools. It launched with just one combined pool of [Dai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) (DAI), [USD Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) (USDC), [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) and [TrueUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/) (TUSD). In December, the project [reported](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1337546455033122816) that the pool had reached nearly $1 billion in total value locked.\n\nAs a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao), Swerve uses an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)-issued [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, SWRV, for governance in addition to rewarding [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider).\n\nThe project was [announced](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1301619585976807428) on Sept. 3, 2020, and [launched](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1302063258195681282) the next day.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Swerve?\n\nSwerve was launched by a pseudonymous developer known as \"John Deere\" who started it as a passion project outside of his full-time job. When asked about his personal background in an \"ask me anything\" session, he [stated](https://swervenewsletter.substack.com/p/swerve-ama-john-deere) that he is \"just a lowly farmer\" who likes \"sane token distributions.\" He has also [said](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-john-deere-the-anonymous) that he has experience in software development and crypto.\n\nAlthough he started it by himself, John Deere has given credit to the community for assisting in its design and implementation. He has [said](https://swervenewsletter.substack.com/p/swervefi-newsletter-3) that while he is guiding the project during its initial growth, he hopes to pass on its development to the community.\n\nIn October 2020, Swerve governance [voted](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1323366680962031616) to hire community member \"FairlyRarePepe\" as an additional developer.\n\n\n#### What Makes Swerve Unique?\n\nSwerve was launched as a community-focused alternative to Curve. Swerve's founder has been very [critical](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-john-deere-the-anonymous) of Curve, saying that the platform is not fairly governed and that its founder has too much power. Swerve's founder has said that it [offers](https://swervenewsletter.substack.com/p/a-note-on-the-future-of-swerve) better swap pricing and [larger](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1330972613489815553) annual percentage yields on stablecoins than other platforms.\n\nSwerve also uses a reward gaming mechanism called \"Boost\" through which liquidity providers that lock up SWRV can receive a higher APY than those that don't boost. The rate at which one's APY is boosted is [determined](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1308857474754195458) by a calculation that incorporates the number of tokens locked by the user and the total amount locked, among other factors.\n\nTrading on the platform is [subject](https://snapshot.page/#/swerve/proposal/QmXRJgtnhyzAZChWr1sXKF1VnmYc7FaBBq9zv9nidogc9S) to a 0.03% fee, of which 50% is awarded to liquidity providers and 50% is taken as an administrative fee and sent to the Swerve treasury, which is [capped](https://snapshot.page/#/swerve/proposal/QmXWEMpWMy8ye7RcJrC9vXkgmxVwH9VqoS3pGW58EYJKvn) at $200,000. In October 2020, its governance [voted](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1321574499498651649) to accept a grant to further build on [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) platform [Serum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serum/) (SRM).\n\nIn October 2020, founder John Deer [stated](https://swervenewsletter.substack.com/p/a-note-on-the-future-of-swerve) that his priorities for the project were to increase the platform's volume and better incentivize the holding of SWRV.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/), the project from which Swerve was forked.\n\nLearn about [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/), the largest decentralized trading protocol.\n\nWant to know more about how DAOs operate? Read an [in-depth explanation](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on the latest developments in decentralized finance and trading with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Swerve (SWRV) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nSwerve has a total token supply of 33 million. All minted SWRV is awarded to liquidity providers, with the development team stating that there was no premine and no tokens allocated to the developers.\n\nNine million SWRV was [distributed](https://swerve.fi/swerve/) during the first two weeks, and another 9 million SWRV will be distributed over the first year. Starting at year two, 3 million SWRV will be distributed per year until all 33 million tokens have been minted by the end of year six.\n\n\n### How Is the Swerve Network Secured?\n\nSWRV is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain), which means that SWRV transactions are validated by the Ethereum network. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nSwerve's treasury is controlled by a small group of multisignature key holders who were selected by a governance [vote](https://swervenewsletter.substack.com/p/swervefi-newsletter-2). Three community members and four external representatives hold the treasury keys.\n\nThe Swerve protocol's [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) were audited by [Cryptic Labs](https://github.com/crypticlabs/swerve-audit-report/blob/master/Swerve%20Finance%20Audit%20-%20by%20Cryptic%20Labs%20v3.pdf) and [Peckshield](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Swerve-v1.0.pdf), both of which found no critical security flaws. However, in October 2020, Swerve [announced](https://twitter.com/SwerveFinance/status/1313421862735499264) that it had been alerted to a security vulnerability in the smart contracts that power the platform, stating that it was working on a fix.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Swerve (SWRV)?\n\nSWRV can be purchased on [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges such as [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), among others. It can be traded against the U.S. dollar, cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), and stablecoins such as [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) and [Binance USD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/) (BUSD).\n\nAre you interested in buying SWRV or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin)?
