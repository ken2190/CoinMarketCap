{"data": {"id": 10924, "name": "Black Diamond", "symbol": "DIAMONDS", "slug": "black-diamond", "category": "token", "description": "Black Diamond is meant to bring financial growth for all its holders using its powerful reflection tokenomics.\r\n\r\nThe tokenomics redistribute 10% of every transaction to holders proportionate to their holdings.\r\nThe remaining 2% of every transaction gets sent to the liquidity pool to consistently increase the price floor. Black Diamond was started as an answer to the demand for higher reflections among Safe tokens. Black Diamond is designed to be the safest coin on the market while offering higher reflections than any other current token. Using the blueprint of BSC's Safemoon contract, the team have improved upon their anti-whale functions by cutting the max transaction amount in half. Black Diamond was proudly created by Veteran and Active Duty U.S Servicemembers.\r\n\r\nThe project also has a charity wallet holds 1% of the total token supply. This wallet will start receiving reflections as soon as the first transaction occurs. These funds will in turn be progressively sold off at predetermined milestones. This will help to ensure the wallet\u2019s longevity and to allow the team to constantly support the National Coalition of Homeless Veterans. An auxiliary effect of this will be maintaining stability & acting as a liquidity pool to help consistently raise the price floor.\r\n\r\nThis wallet will also be consistently funded with 5% of net profits from our merchandising agreement & is subject to change as we aim to increase that number.\r\n\r\nWe will also use this wallet to directly help individual homeless Veterans get off the streets & into housing whilst helping them seek stable employment. We plan to have community run competitions with the aim of encouraging the Black Diamond family to promote our core values and create mass awareness. These campaigns will be broadcast across our social media pages with accompanying GoFundMe links to allow all viewers to personally help each Veteran we support, to ensure they stay in a position that allows proper stability.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to help our investors to become financially independent whilst taking every step we can to help those most in need who have literally given everything to support their independent countries. All gave some, some gave all. The Project's plan is to show them that there are people out there who believe that means something.
