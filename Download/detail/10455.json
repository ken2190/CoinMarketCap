{"data": {"id": 10455, "name": "Eqifi", "symbol": "EQX", "slug": "eqifi", "category": "token", "description": "EQIFI will be a decentralized protocol for pooled lending, borrowing, and investing for ETH, ERC-20 tokens including wBTC, Stablecoins, and select fiat currencies. It will provide a single uniform platform for DeFi products with EQIBank bank accounts, loans, custody, debit and credit cards, OTC, and wealth management.\r\n\r\nWith EQIFI, the entire digital asset, blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem of traders, investors, developers, exchanges and app users may borrow against multi-type assets without selling.\r\n\r\nApps may borrow assets for use in the Ethereum ecosystem without waiting for an order to close or requiring off-chain activity. Similarly, speculators may deploy a variety of trading techniques, including shorting, to maximise their opportunity, while miners may borrow against an extensive selection of collateral.\r\n\r\nThe Eqifi platform will have 4 main products:\r\n1) Fixed Rate Products\r\nEQIFi Fixed Rate Products are pooled loans at a fixed interest rate that settle on a specified future date. The user provides collateral in the form of ETH, wBTC, Stablecoins, and select fiat currencies (which are converted into stablecoins) into pools, which have fixed rates attached to it. The interest rates are algorithmically set through a smart-contract.\r\n\r\n2) Variable Rate Products\r\nEQIFi Variable Rate Products feature algorithmic borrow rates, making the marketplace more vibrant and automatically responsive to changes across the network based on user activity and demand thus increasing levels of borrowing from the token pool. With more demand for borrowing, the interest rates automatically rise, which drives more lenders to participate.\r\n\r\n3) Interest Rate Swaps\r\nEQIFi Interest Rate Swaps are a DeFi forward contract in which one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another based on a specified principal amount. Interest rate swaps usually involve the exchange of a fixed interest rate for a variable rate, or vice versa, to reduce or increase exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. This product minimizes the volatility of variable rate lending and certain money market products.\r\n\r\n4) Yield Aggregator\r\nEQIFi Yield Aggregator is an automated aggregator of all leading external yield farming products, making yield farming simple and automatic. It is designed to be accessible to those familiar with DeFi and yield farming and also those entirely new to the sector. The platform seeks to be the world\u2019s leading self-investment platform and automatically assigns capital between different liquidity pools in order to pursue the best possible profit and margin at all times.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-16T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "icoStatus": "untracked_ico", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "3871", "dateLaunched": "2021-06-14T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://eqifi.com/"], "technical_doc": [], "explorer": [], "source_code": [], "message_board": ["https://eqifi.com/blog/\r\nhttps://eqifi.medium.com/"], "chat": ["https://t.me/eqifi"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/eqifi_finance"]}, "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 45.93913845067335, "priceChangePercentage24h": 35.10541915, "priceChangePercentage7d": 51.63438799}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.33773955512395, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.23981776, "priceChangePercentage7d": 20.41715042}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04592046794645, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.23029735, "priceChangePercentage7d": 17.9758293}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.35127535261967, "priceChangePercentage24h": 16.82483551, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.48350721}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08803051270921, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.32754572, "priceChangePercentage7d": 22.77415107}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.35123930522357, "priceChangePercentage24h": 5.26227592, "priceChangePercentage7d": 11.22685562}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.86320486217138, "priceChangePercentage24h": 12.14307618, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.6744906}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12884102685655, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.39973257, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.44788409}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.05262628984308, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.4797596, "priceChangePercentage7d": 14.13563895}], "relatedExchanges": [], "ico": {"cryptoId": 10455, "cryptoSymbol": "EQX", "status": "Upcoming", "cryptoStatus": 16, "name": "Eqifi", "statistic": {"tokensForSale": 0.0, "raisedInUsd": 0.0}, "stages": [{"status": "Upcoming", "type": "IDO", "icoPriceUsd": "", "personalCap": "200 USD", "distributedInIcoPercentage": 0, "access": "Public", "comments": "How to Participate?\n1) Follow Eqifi Twitter: https://twitter.com/eqifi_finance\n2) Join Eqifi Telegram Group:  https://t.me/eqifi\n3) Join Eqifi Announcement Channel:  https://t.me/EQIFI_Announcements\n4) Results will be announced on the Telegram account - https://t.me/eqifi", "fundraisingGoalUsd": "", "whereToBuyName": "-", "whereToBuyUrl": "", "acceptedCurrency": ""}]}, "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T11:52:16.734Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "8", "credit_count": 0}}
