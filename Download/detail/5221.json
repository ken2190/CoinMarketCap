{"data": {"id": 5221, "name": "Handshake", "symbol": "HNS", "slug": "handshake", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is Handshake (HNS)?\n\nHandshake is a decentralized permissionless system that is intended to incentivize a distributed network of computers to operate a system for domain name ownership. \n\n \n\nUnder Handshake, every peer is tasked with validating and managing the root DNS naming zone, with the objective of providing an alternative to current certificate authorities and naming systems. \n\n \n\nDifferent participants across the internet such as social networking handles and domains rely on a centralized approach. This means the systems depend on a system of honesty \u2014 and are still prone to cyber attacks and fraud. \n\n \n\nHandshake aims to eradicate this problem by creating a decentralized internet that relies on a peer-to-peer system. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Handshake? \n\nJoseph Poon and Andrew Lee are the two main co-founders of Handshake. \n\nLee quit a job at Merrill Lynch to co-found Purse \u2014 one of the largest marketplaces for Bitcoin in early 2014. As Purse expanded, he began to explore other ways of innovating in the marketplace and investing in infrastructure.\n\nHe and Poon had been discussing the ideas underpinning Handshake for years before they co-founded the company. \n\nAside from developing Handshake, Poon co-wrote the Plasma Papers in collaboration with Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. \n\nPoon worked at a Big Four accounting firm before becoming involved in the crypto space, while in between jobs. He\u2019s also the co-creator of the Lightning Network and Plasma. \n\nOther co-founders include Boyma Fahnbulleh and Christopher Jeffrey.\n\n\n#### What Makes Handshake Unique?\n\nOne of the most unique features of Handshake is that it is not a blockchain project looking to fully decentralize current DNS infrastructure. It is rather about decentralizing the root zone \u2014 and/or the top-level domains. \n\nThis is because apart from the root zone, the entire of DNS is already decentralized. \n\nHandshake\u2019s white paper states: \u201cthe Handshake naming protocol differs from its predecessors in that it has no concept of _namespacing_ or subdomains at the consensus layer. Its role is not to replace all of DNS, but to replace the root zone file and the root servers.\u201d\n\nA key concept about Handshake is that it aims to decentralize or reduce dependence on the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN.)\n\nICANN was launched in 1998 as a non-profit partnership made of people across the globe, with the aim of keeping the internet more secure. \n\nHandshake instead aims to use a decentralized application based on Proof-of-Work principles to improve the security of the internet. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about the difference between [proof-of-work and proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake).\n\nCheck out our [deep dive into decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance).\n\nLearn about cryptocurrencies with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/).\n\n \\\nSubscribe to the [CoinMarketCap newsletter](https://coinmarketcap.com/newsletter).\n\n\n#### How Many Handshake Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe maximum supply of Handshake coins is fixed at 2.04 billion \u2014 and at present, there are approximately 355 million coins in circulation.\n\n\n### How Is Handshake Secured?\n\nHandshake is secured using the unspent transaction output (UTXO) of the blockchain and uses the principles of proof-of-work (PoW) in the same way as Bitcoin.\n\nThe naming system comprises on-chain smart contract features which are known as covenants, which are intended to limit the use of future transaction output. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Handshake (HNS)?\n\nHandshake is traded on more than a dozen exchanges. The most known exchanges for buying and selling Handshake are Bittrex, Gate.io, BigOne, MXC.com and ZB.com.
