{"data": {"id": 3164, "name": "PumaPay", "symbol": "PMA", "slug": "pumapay", "category": "token", "description": "## What Is PumaPay (PMA)?\n\n\n## What is PumaPay?\n  \n\nPumaPay is the first DeFi payment protocol to facilitate subscription payments and other advanced billing models. It democratizes payments by providing a solution that is permissionless, frictionless, free and open for all.   \n\nWith the introduction of its pioneered technology, the PullPayment Protocol, PumaPay was the first project to inverse the direction of crypto value transfers to enable a \u201cpull\u201d rather than \u201cpush\u201d mechanism. This technology allows merchants to accept payments by pulling funds from customers\u2019 wallets according to predefined terms. \n\nPumaPay currently facilitates fast, cost-efficient crypto payments for high-risk industry giants in Adult Entertainment, Gaming & more. It is available for free and offers a set of tools that enable smooth value transfers between merchants and individuals. This includes a business console, native mobile app, and fiat settlement layer. \n\nAll transactions on the protocol are executed with its native token, PMA. An ERC20 token, it is the powerhouse behind PumaPay. \n\n\n## Who are the Founders of PumaPay?\n \n\nThe firm behind PumaPay is known as Decentralized Vision. The company currently has over 20 employees, many of whom have overlapping roles at PumaPay.  \n\nPumaPay was co-founded by Yoav Dror, who still operates as the CEO of the platform to this day. Dror has an extensive history of holding executive roles at prominent firms and has more than 20 years of experience heading online high-transaction companies. The other co-founders are not public facing. \n\nBesides Dror, the PumaPay executive team also includes Giorgos Kourtellos \u2013 PumaPay's CTO. With a background in engineering and extensive professional experience in blockchain development at the IBM Client Innovation Center, Giorgos plays a significant role in the direction and development of the platform.   \n\n\n## What Makes PumaPay Unique?\n  \n\nPumaPay\u2019s main feature is its PullPayment Protocol.  \n\nThe PullPayment Protocol is composed of a unique architecture of smart contracts. A pioneered technology, the protocol facilitates the entire solution and controls the logic of transactions within the platform. This is powered by its native token, PMA, as it is the sole means of value transfer within the protocol.  \n\nThis technology is unique in that it enables new, previously unheard of, crypto billing methodologies on the blockchain by inversing the mechanics of crypto transactions to allow merchants to \u201cpull\u201d payments from customers according to predefined terms.  \n\nPumaPay currently utilizes their technology to enable advanced billing models such as:  \n\n\n* Subscriptions  \n* Auto top-ups \n* Pay-per-time \n* Pay-per-use \n* Direct Debit and more.\n  \n \n\n\n## How Many PumaPay (PMA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n  \n\nAs per the\u00a0PumaPay\u00a0[whitepaper](https://pumapay.io/docs/pumapay_whitepaper.pdf), the total supply of\u00a0PumaPay\u00a0tokens is allocated as follows: 35% to Decentralized Vision Ltd to be used for the development of the protocol and future strategy; 20% to public contributors; 20% to launch partners and early adopters; 15% to advisors, professional fees and bonuses; and 10% to the founders and team. \n\n \n\n\n## How Is the PumaPay (PMA) Network Secured?\n \n\nPumaPay\u00a0was built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is secured by the combined efforts of thousands of Ethereum miners and nodes, which act to enforce its\u00a0[proof-of-work (PoW)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)\u00a0consensus algorithm to resist attacks,\u00a0including\u00a0[51%](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack)\u00a0and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, the token smart contract has been audited by third-party providers who confirmed that the project meets all required standards --- to date, no major vulnerabilities have ever been found in the PMA token contract.\u00a0\n\nThough\u00a0PumaPay\u00a0currently operates on Ethereum, it has the capacity to migrate to a different network if needed.\u00a0\n\n## Where Can You Buy PumaPay (PMA)?\n \n\nPumaPay\u00a0is available to purchase directly within the\u00a0[PumaPay wallet mobile app](https://pumapay.onelink.me/9I7q/4095a16a)\u00a0as well as on several top-tier exchanges\u00a0including\u00a0[OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/),\u00a0[HitBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hitbtc/),\u00a0[Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/), and\u00a0[Bitsdaq](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitsdaq/).\u00a0\n\nTraders will be able to find PMA paired against\u00a0[Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on several exchanges, whereas PMA can also be traded against U.S. dollars (USD) on\u00a0HitBTC.  \nIt\u2019s important to note that transactions on PumaPay\u2019s protocol are free besides the Ethereum [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price). Thanks to the use of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain), every transaction is immutable, and chargebacks are impossible, giving merchants peace of mind when accepting crypto payments.\n\nDecentralization also plays a big part in the platform\u2019s ambitions. Since customers can directly interact with businesses without the need for another third-party or middleman, this can help keep costs down by removing unnecessary platform fees and payment processor charges. \n\nThe project was created in 2017 and held an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) in May 2018, raising ~$117 million by selling a total of 78 billion PMA tokens. The PMA token itself is used to provide quick and cheap transactions via PumaPay's PullPayment protocol, enabling subscription-based payments, micro-transactions and shared payments to maximize flexibility for customers and retailers. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of PumaPay (PMA)?\n\nPumaPay was co-founded by Yoav Dror, who still operates as the CEO of the platform to this day. Dror has an extensive history of holding executive roles at prominent firms and has more than 20 years of experience heading up online high-transaction companies. The other co-founders are not public-facing. \n\nBesides Dror, the PumaPay executive team also includes Aristos Christofides \u2014 PumaPay\u2019s CTO \u2014 who has a masters in electronic engineering and more than 15 years of experience in commercial application development. Giorgos Kourtellos is PumaPay\u2019s chief blockchain architect and previously worked at IBM Client Innovation Center as a full-stack blockchain developer for four years. \n\nThe firm behind PumaPay is known as Decentralized Vision. The company [currently](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2227123779%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH) has over 20 employees, many of whom have overlapping roles at PumaPay. \n\n\n### What Makes PumaPay (PMA) Unique?\n\nOne of PumaPay\u2019s main features is the complete mitigation of volatility while providing 100% liquidity to merchants. The project achieves this by using an innovative fiat settlement layer which cancels out volatility and ensures liquidity by locking the PMA exchange rate at the moment of each transaction. \n\nFlexibility is also one of PumaPay\u2019s strengths since it allows businesses and customers to choose between one-time-only and recurring payment options like \u201cpay-per-time\u201d or \u201cpay-per-use.\u201d This solution makes PMA useful as a payment method since it can now be used to settle subscription-type payments without requiring authorization each time a payment needs to be made, due to PumaPay\u2019s unique PullPayment protocol. \n\nPumaPay has created a range of services, products and tools to enable Payment Service Providers (PSPs) to easily join the platform and provide their services to thousands of customers worldwide. The platform is also PCI DSS Services Provider Certified, which provides peace of mind to PSPs looking to integrate the PumaPay APIs. \n\n\n### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) \u2014 the popular distributed computing platform.\n\nFollow [XRP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) \u2014 a digital asset used for cross-border payment settlements.\n\nStuck on a crypto term?

The platform currently has a circulating supply of just over one-third of this, at 26.4 billion PMA as of October 2020. \n\nThe project concluded its ICO on May 7, 2018, after collecting around $117 million by selling 50,000 PMA for 1 ETH during the PumaPay pre-sale and 25,000 PMA for 1 ETH at the ICO price. \n\nAs per the PumaPay [white paper](https://pumapay.io/docs/pumapay_whitepaper.pdf), the total supply of PumaPay tokens is allocated as follows: 35% to Decentralized Vision Ltd to be used for the development of the protocol and future strategy; 20% to public contributors; 20% to launch partners and early adopters; 15% to advisors, professional fees and bonuses; and 10% to the founders and team.\n\n\n### How Is the PumaPay (PMA) Network Secured?\n\nPumaPay was built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is secured by the combined efforts of thousands of Ethereum miners and nodes, which act to enforce its [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) consensus algorithm to resist attacks, including [51%](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. \n\nAdditionally, the token smart contract has been audited by third-party providers who confirmed that the project meets all required standards \u2014 to date, no major vulnerabilities have ever been found in the PMA token contract. \n\nThough PumaPay currently operates on Ethereum, it has the capacity to migrate to a different network if needed, such as if a superior alternative arises that better fits its needs. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy PumaPay (PMA)?\n\nPumaPay is available to purchase and trade on several top-tier exchanges including OKEx, Bittrex and HitBTC. Traders will be able to find PMA paired against [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on several exchanges, whereas PMA can also be traded against U.S. dollars (USD) on HitBTC.\n\nDon\u2019t have any assets to trade against PMA?
