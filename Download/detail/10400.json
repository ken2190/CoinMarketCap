{"data": {"id": 10400, "name": "Bogecoin", "symbol": "BOGE", "slug": "bogecoin", "category": "token", "description": "What Is Bogecoin (BOGE)?\n\n\nBOGE is a deflationary, autostaking, and secure token built on Binance Smart Chain which powers the BSCgems.com launch pad voting application for new BSC projects.  The coin has been audited by TechRate and has shown to be secure and without any major solidity issues that would compromise the safety of its users. \n\nBogecoin developers launched BSCgems (bscgems.com), which is a decentralized application that allows tokens on the Binance Smart Chain network to compete weekly via a voting mechanism, while allowing users to explore different coins and view their financial metrics. Submitters of new tokens must hold a predetermined amount of BOGE in order to have their projects listed on the platform. Premium features of the app are being developed and will require users to hold BOGE in order to have access to additional financial metrics. New features are being added weekly, including the recent addition of financial charts for each of the token projects, including market capitalization and candle charts. \n\nThis launch pad gives tokens the ability to promote their project in front of a captive audience, with a fair voting mechanism to prevent spam and bot voting. In just under a month, the application has already gained over 28,000 unique visitors according to Google Analytics metrics, and has amassed over 1,400 followers on Twitter for BSCgems, and over 6,000 followers for Bogecoin\n\n\nHow Many BOGE Tokens Are There in Circulation?\n\nBOGE launched its project on April 19, 2021 with 2 million tokens created at genesis. 50% of initial supply was burned by sending it the tokens to a common burn address ( 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in order to initiate the autostaking/reflection proportions. \n\nEvery transaction 2% is burned and redistributed to token holders, including to the burn wallet. Over time, the burn wallet will accumulate a higher percentage of total holdings, and the coin will become more deflationary, helping to push the price higher via deflationary tokenomics. The coin was fair-launched on April 19th, 2021 and the Bogecoin team bought into the project at the same time as the general public, with no developer wallets allocated prior to launch. \n\nWhere Can I Buy BOGEl?\n\nBOGE is available in decentralized liquidity pools such as WindSwap and PancakeSwap on the Binance Smart Chain network. \n\nPancakeSwap (Listed April 19th, 2021): https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x248c45af3b2f73bc40fa159f2a90ce9cad7a77ba\n\nWindSwap  (Listed May 2nd, 2021): https://app.windswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x248c45af3b2f73bc40fa159f2a90ce9cad7a77ba \n\nThe team claims they are also in talks with multiple centralized exchanges including Coin Tiger and Bitrue for a USDT pair.", "dateAdded": "2021-06-10T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "active", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "2021-07-31T11:50:25.000Z", "watchCount": "1166", "dateLaunched":
