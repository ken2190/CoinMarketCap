With two Neuralinks implanted in the motor cortex area of his brain, Pager begins his legendary life by playing Pong with his mind.\r\n\r\n2-MonkiSwap is going to be launched at LATE MAY.\r\n\r\n3-BANANA NFT is an off-chain platform that allows individual buyers and sellers to easily trade with collectibles(NFTs) without having previous experience.\r\n\r\nThe glittering of BANANA NFT is that it will provide a new auction mechanism for global bidders. MONKI has developed an auction bidding mechanism based on the \"simultaneous upward bidding theory\" (i.e., synchronous multi-round auction theory, SMRA) which is proposed by Paul Milgram, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics in 2020.\r\n\r\nEach bid will provide several rounds of quotation, the quotation can be repeated. After bidder finalized the price, the algorithm will choose the highest price and regard it as the initial price of the second round auction, and then the second round quotation begins. If price makes a new high, the bidding ends. Otherwise the bidding will continue as usual until there is no new high price.\r\n\r\nThe BANANA platform will become a brand new market for small and micro auction enthusiasts in the world.", "dateAdded": "2021-05-17T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "untracked", "notice": "", "latestUpdateTime": "", "watchCount": "23", "dateLaunched": "2021-04-22T00:00:00.000Z", "tags": [], "urls": {"website": ["https://monki.network/"], "technical_doc": ["https://monki.network/"], "explorer": ["https://bscscan.com/address/0xb813939458aa42ca57b870bef4bec24945adda6d"], "source_code": [], "message_board": [], "chat": ["https://t.me/monkigroup"], "announcement": [], "reddit": [], "twitter": ["https://twitter.com/MonkiNetwork"]}, "platforms": [{"contractId": 1839, "contractAddress": "0xb813939458aa42ca57b870bef4bec24945adda6d", "contractPlatform": "Binance Smart Chain", "contractPlatformId": 14, "contractChainId": 56, "contractRpcUrl": ["https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org", "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/", "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443"], "contractNativeCurrencyName": "Binance Chain Native Token", "contractNativeCurrencySymbol": "BNB", "contractNativeCurrencyDecimals": 18, "contractBlockExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/", "contractExplorerUrl": "https://bscscan.com/token/0xb813939458aa42ca57b870bef4bec24945adda6d", "contractDecimals": 18, "platformCryptoId": 1839}], "relatedCoins": [{"id": 1376, "name": "Neo", "slug": "neo", "price": 47.20183531244782, "priceChangePercentage24h": 39.13616826, "priceChangePercentage7d": 53.95596503}, {"id": 6636, "name": "Polkadot", "slug": "polkadot-new", "price": 16.11344337944072, "priceChangePercentage24h": 10.18449042, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.48248837}, {"id": 109, "name": "DigiByte", "slug": "digibyte", "price": 0.04627457717797, "priceChangePercentage24h": 8.91135231, "priceChangePercentage7d": 19.45883406}, {"id": 1817, "name": "Voyager Token", "slug": "voyager-token", "price": 2.34617322631426, "priceChangePercentage24h": 18.30909192, "priceChangePercentage7d": 25.55452378}, {"id": 3077, "name": "VeChain", "slug": "vechain", "price": 0.08821362409385, "priceChangePercentage24h": 9.42255504, "priceChangePercentage7d": 23.13615696}, {"id": 1567, "name": "Nano", "slug": "nano", "price": 4.32662201481798, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.95126771, "priceChangePercentage7d": 10.27161668}, {"id": 7226, "name": "Injective Protocol", "slug": "injective-protocol", "price": 6.69640107233936, "priceChangePercentage24h": 11.40482406, "priceChangePercentage7d": 16.5160507}, {"id": 2062, "name": "Aion", "slug": "aion", "price": 0.12783130067915, "priceChangePercentage24h": 6.95747271, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.47362042}, {"id": 3890, "name": "Polygon", "slug": "polygon", "price": 1.04646931829133, "priceChangePercentage24h": 4.2717338, "priceChangePercentage7d": 12.71622843}], "relatedExchanges": [], "wallets": [{"id": 9025, "name": "MetaMask", "tier": 1, "url": "https://metamask.io/", "chains": "ETH,ETZ", "types": "pc", "introduction": "", "star": 1.0, "security": 2.0, "easyToUse": 4.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "rank": 1000013, "logo": "9025.png", "multipleChain": true}, {"id": 9152, "name": "Binance Chain Wallet", "url": "https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/", "chains": "BNB", "types": "", "introduction": "", "star": 0.0, "security": 0.0, "easyToUse": 0.0, "decentration": false, "focusNumber": 0, "logo": "9152.png", "multipleChain": false}], "isAudited": false}, "status": {"timestamp": "2021-07-31T09:37:59.207Z", "error_code": "0", "error_message": "SUCCESS", "elapsed": "7", "credit_count": 0}}
