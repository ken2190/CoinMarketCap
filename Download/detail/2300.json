{"data": {"id": 2300, "name": "WAX", "symbol": "WAXP", "slug": "wax", "category": "coin", "description": "## What Is WAX (WAXP)?\n\nWAX (WAXP) is a purpose-built blockchain, released in 2017, that is designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, simpler and safer for every party involved. The WAX blockchain uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) as its consensus mechanism. It is fully compatible with EOS.\n\nThe custom features and the incentive mechanisms developed by WAX are intended to optimize the blockchain\u2019s utility specifically for use in e-commerce, with the goal of encouraging voting on proposals. \n\nTo make this possible, WAX created a suite of blockchain-based tools which decentralized application ([DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) marketplaces and non-fungible tokens can be built upon.\n\nServices such as WAX Cloud Wallet, SSO and OAUTH support e-commerce operations, the latter being a native RNG service and a developer portal. WAX\u2019s blockchain architecture supports 500-millisecond block time and zero-fee transactions for customers. It also makes use of voting rewards to incentivize participation in the selection of block producers and improvement proposals.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of WAX?\n\nWAX was co-founded by William Quigley and Jonathan Yantis.\n\nWilliam Quigley studied at the University of Southern California, and then worked at Disney. After leaving Disney in the early 1990s, he got an MBA at Harvard and became a venture capitalist. Over time, he became the managing director at Idealab. Alongside creating WAX, he is also the managing director at Magnetic.\n\nJonathan Yantis works as the chief operating officer at WAX and as the chief operating officer at OPSkins.\n\n\n#### What Makes WAX Unique?\n\nWAX features a WAXP-to-Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) bridge that allows WAXP token holders to convert their tokens into WAXE, which is an Ethereum-based ERC20 utility token.\n\nUsers willing to participate in WAX tokenomics need to burn their WAXP tokens in order to get WAXE through the Ethereum bridge. They will then need to stake the WAXE tokens on the Ethereum distribution contract.\n\nWAXG is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 governance token that is distributed to WAXE stakers. The distribution is based on a set timetable and is proportionate to the percentage of the WAX Economic Activity pool. The token holders can govern the allocation and distribution of economic value on the platform as a result.\n\nThe WAX Economic Activity pool is a smart contract that accumulates a percentage of generated WAX fees and can be converted into ETH for distribution to WAXE stakers. It can also be given to WAXG token holders that decide to burn the tokens they already have.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [1inch](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/1inch/).\n\nLearn more about [Stacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/1inch/).\n\nLearn about Web 3.0 on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0).\n\nImprove your knowledge in crypto on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many WAX (WAXP) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nWAX (WAXP) has a circulating supply of 1,513,825,734 tokens as of February 2021 and a maximum supply of 3,770,303,327 WAXP.\n\n\n### How Is the WAX Network Secured?\n\nWAX network\u2019s DPoS consensus is secure against the corruption of a significant minority or producers. Token holders can select WAX guilds by voting in a continuous approval system. They can get an opportunity to produce blocks and token holders can persuade other token holders to vote for them.\n\nA block gets produced on the WAX blockchain every 0.5 seconds; as such, one WAX guild gets authorized to produce a block at any given point in time. If a block does not get produced at the scheduled time, the block for that time slot is skipped. When one or more blocks end up getting skipped, another gap in the blockchain of 0.5 seconds or more is added.\n\nWAX guilds do not receive WAX rewards if they produce 50% or less of the scheduled blocks, which discourages skipping blocks.\n\nWAX has created a full suite of blockchain-based tools that allow anyone to trade digital or physical items instantly and securely.\n\n\n### Where Can You
